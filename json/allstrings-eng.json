 "A1Q1AfterInitAkara": "46I should add that many Rogue scouts have died in that horrible place. We cannot afford to lose any more. If you choose to enter that Den of Evil, you must do so alone.",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt": "95You seem like a noble warrior. I hope you can help us.",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain": "95The beasts from the cave have begun to roam throughout the countryside. You'd better be careful out there.",
 "A1Q1AfterInitGheed": "67You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust my sacred scepter into the foulest, carbuncular trull than set one boot into that cave.",
 "A1Q1AfterInitKashya": "87The demons in that cave have claimed many of my finest archers. I wonder how you will fare!",
 "A1Q1AfterInitWarriv": "122One who seeks that cave, seeks death.",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara": "85Your task is not complete until you have killed all the demons in that cave.",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi": "148You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do you need anything?",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed": "73Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I think you might need a new weapon.",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya": "111You'd better come through on this. Your reputation depends on it.",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv": "124One who hesitates... does so with good reason.",
 "A1Q1InitAkara": "43There is a place of great evil in the wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave.\n\nI fear that these creatures are massing for an attack against our encampment. If you are sincere about helping us, find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.\n\nMay the Great Eye watch over you.",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulAkara": "65You have cleansed the Den of Evil. You've earned my trust and may yet restore my faith in humanity.\n\nYour reward is training in the skill of your choice.",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi": "94You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara was worried about you.",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulGheed": "87The only good demon is a dead one, I say.\n\nBy the way, did you happen to find anything in that cave you'd like to sell?",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulKashya": "74Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may reward you.",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv": "120...That which does not kill you makes you stronger.",
 "A1Q2AfterInitAkara": "51Blood Raven fought valiantly against Diablo in the catacombs beneath Tristram... She was never quite the same afterwards. It is now obvious she brought an evil influence back with her.",
 "A1Q2AfterInitCharsi": "99Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue band that once fought Diablo at Tristram.",
 "A1Q2AfterInitGheed": "94I'm sorry... The undead are bad for trade. I have a strict no-return policy.",
 "A1Q2AfterInitKashya": "80Death has done nothing to weaken Blood Raven's combat skills. If anything, she's more deadly than ever.",
 "A1Q2AfterInitWarriv": "140Hmmm...\n\nHow can one kill what is already dead?",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara": "70If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear that our Order will perish forever.",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi": "68Akara felt something was wrong even before Andariel descended upon us. She feared that Blood Raven had stumbled upon some evil force beneath Tristram.\n\nI wish we had acted then...",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed": "77I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on everybody.",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya": "99Each moment you delay adds another undead Sister to Blood Raven's army.",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv": "86When the dead return to prey upon the living, it is a terror beyond understanding.",
 "A1Q2InitKashya": "56My Rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the Monastery graveyard!\n\nApparently, Andariel is not content to take only our living. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains in the battle against Diablo at Tristram, was also one of the first to be corrupted by Andariel.\n\nNow, you'll find her in the Monastery graveyard raising our dead as zombies!\n\nWe cannot abide this defilement! If you are truly our ally, you will help us destroy her.",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulAkara": "122Andariel must be made to pay for her sacrilege!",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi": "77Kashya wishes to reward you for your defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, too, even though Blood Raven was once my friend.",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulGheed": "148Some of those gals weren't so nice the first time around.",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulKashya": "55I can hardly believe that you've defeated Blood Raven!\n\nThough she was once my closest friend, I pray that her tortured spirit remains banished forever.\n\nYou have earned my respect, stranger... and the allegiance of the Rogues. I have placed several of my best warriors at your disposal.",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv": "104You've done well, stranger. I hope all your efforts are worth it.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitAkara": "59The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is not without risk. Our Monastery is filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd best be careful, my friend.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCain": "51The Malus was forged and enchanted by the ancient Horadric Mages during the Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, the Malus was entrusted to the Sisterhood guarding the pass into the East.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCharsi": "87The Monastery can confuse even those who know it well. Stay alert in there.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheed": "74Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but this Horadric Malus. Between you and her my ears need a rest.\n\nJust find it and bring it back quickly.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt": "74I have offered my nomadic phallus, but to no avail.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitKashya": "61Charsi is wasting her time and talents using an inferior hammer! Had she the Horadric Malus, she could make the steel sing and craft you a suit of armor as impenetrable as the Great Eye.",
 "A1Q3AfterInitWarriv": "68Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, or a draughtsman pen and paper, so Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with which to ply her trade.",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara": "98If you can't carry out this quest, how will you face the greater evils ahead?",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, search thoroughly in the Barracks... That is where the Rogues kept their forge.",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi": "89The Malus is a Horadric artifact of great power. Please bring it back.",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed": "90I have heard that you bear us no Malus.",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya": "71To do battle with Andariel requires more than thick skin and a strong will. You'll want armor and weaponry forged with the hammer's enchantments.",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv": "120What better opportunity to show your mettle?",
 "A1Q3InitCharsi": "66When I fled the Monastery, I left behind the Horadric Malus, my enchanted smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen your equipment.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulAkara": "57Well done, my friend. But remember, the return of the Horadric Malus is but one step in reclaiming the Monastery.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCain": "59The magical effects imbued by the Malus are impossible to predict, but are always to the good.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi": "72Oh! Thanks so much for returning the Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of your items with magical powers.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulGheed": "120I guess it's too late to take back some of the names I called you.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulKashya": "74Now that the Horadric Malus is back in our possession, we shall use it to deliver a great blow against the Evil which torments this land.",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv": "118I am glad the hammer has returned and you with it.",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara": "42Tristram is too far to journey by foot...  Cain would likely be dead, when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly.\n\nTo open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.\n\nYou must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss and bring back its bark. I will translate the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic pattern.",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi": "117If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, Akara will tell you how to get to Tristram.",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollGheed": "98I would sooner micturate in a tankard of my own ale than journey to Tristram!",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollKashya": "90The bark of Inifuss holds mystical runes.\n\nAkara can translate them... into our revenge!",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollWarriv": "68Months ago, I came across a few survivors from Tristram. They said that Cain had gone half-mad and could no longer distinguish fact from fantasy.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnAkara": "64If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram before all is lost!",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnCharsi": "92I have heard that Tristram is now in ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin of all of us.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnGheed": "68I'm told that Tristram now resembles a mead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! I will wait here for your most glorious return.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnKashya": "103Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge about the Evils we face. You must find him!",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSAkara": "76How will you find Cain without going to Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is the first step on your journey.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSGheed": "99Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll find it, just keep looking.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSKashya": "96The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but you'll know it when you see it.",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSWarriv": "70He who seeks that which cannot be found must look inside himself for further guidance... or look harder!",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnWarriv": "82It is too dangerous to travel to Tristram. I won't be leaving here until the way is clear!",
 "A1Q4InitAkara": "50It is clear that we are facing an Evil difficult to comprehend, let alone combat.\n\nThere is only one Horadrim sage, schooled in the most arcane history and lore, who could advise us... His name is Deckard Cain.\n\nYou must go to Tristram and find him, my friend. I pray that he still lives.",
 "A1Q4InstructionsAkara": "64Ah, very good. I have translated the runes on this scroll. You must find the Cairn Stones and touch them in the order that I have written.",
 "A1Q4InstructionsCharsi": "150Without the bark of Inifuss you can't find Cain.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulAkara": "82You have risked your life to rescue Cain. For that we thank you.\n\nWe must seek his counsel immediately.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCain": "74As a token of my gratitude, I will identify items for you at no charge.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCharsi": "102Akara wishes to reward you for your bravery in returning Deckard Cain.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulGheed": "53Ah, Cain is here... another customer. I haven't been this pleased since a love-starved maiden let down a bit more than her hair.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulKashya": "78Again, you amaze me, outlander.\n\nThe Sisterhood is grateful to you for delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara has something to tell you.",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulWarriv": "80Only a brave adventurer could return with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward for your valor.",
 "A1Q4RescuedByHeroCain": "82...I thank you, friend, for coming to my aid.",
 "A1Q4RescuedByRoguesCain": "75Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They finally rescued me from that cursed place!",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollCharsi": "168Get this to Akara.\n\nOnly she can understand it.",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollGheed": "72Look, friend... I trade a lot of strange items, but I'm not going to start dealing in bark. Okay?",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollKashya": "82With this scroll you may open a portal back to Tristram. Only Akara can decipher its logic.",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollWarriv": "86This looks like gibberish to me. Akara may know what to make of it.",
 "A1Q4TragedyOfTristramCain": "33Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!\n\nAs you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram.  And when our hero emerged triumphant from the labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.\n\nYet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out of his mind.\n\nThe hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.\n\nOne day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.\n\nI believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.\n\nI fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.\n\nYou must stop him or all will be lost.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitAkara": "67The dangers there are not solely architectural. Once inside that wretched place, many succumb to a vile miasma.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCain": "60That tower marks a place of danger. There is an epic poem about it...  How much sorrow one can stand was tested there.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCharsi": "70That old tower is as rotten on the inside as it appears on the outside. I heard that several Sisters came to a gruesome end when a stairwell collapsed on them.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitGheed": "110The only wealth you're likely to find there is a wealth of vermin.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitKashya": "78The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we have found are death, delirium, and disappointment.",
 "A1Q5AfterInitWarriv": "81Rumors of treasure are no different from rumors of any other kind. They hold false promise to those who should know better.",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnAkara": "140There is no more I can tell you about that ancient tower.",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCain": "94Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCharsi": "170You're not ready to give up, are you?",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnGheed": "79Guess what! I've named a boil on my ass after you. It, too, bothers me every time I sit down.",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnKashya": "151Have you suddenly lost your taste for wealth?",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnWarriv": "118Better an empty pocket than a full grave.",
 "A1Q5InitQuestTome": "36...And so it came to pass that the Countess, who once bathed in the rejuvenating blood of a hundred virgins, was buried alive... And her castle in which so many cruel deeds took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising over the buried dungeons in that god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary tower, like some monument to Evil, is all that remains.\n\nThe Countess' fortune was believed to be divided among the clergy, although some say that more remains unfound, still buried alongside the rotting skulls that bear mute witness to the inhumanity of the human creature.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulAkara": "58I thought the stories of treasure in the tower were nothing but lies. I am glad you found something of value in that death-trap. Would that our Sisters had been so fortunate.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCain": "69Well done, my friend. Courage and opportunity together have created in you a kind of alchemy.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCharsi": "126Those riches will serve you well on the long road ahead.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulGheed": "68Warriv's advice is like corpse gas; it befouls the air for a moment and then it disappears.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulKashya": "79Your rewards are well-earned. To us, the tower was nothing more than a headstone looming over a long forgotten grave.",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulWarriv": "62Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial as a cloud and passes as quickly. Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not bold.",
 "A1Q6AfterInitAkara": "63Andariel has desecrated all we hold dear. She must not be permitted to serve Diablo.\n\nDestroy her! Her corruption of our Order must be undone!",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCain": "45Diablo is heading east for some foul purpose. And the only passage east is through the Monastery gate. Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel to block any pursuit.\n\nFor her part Andariel hopes to win Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are always vying for positions of power within the unholy hierarchy!",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCharsi": "132Send Andariel back to the Hell she came from!",
 "A1Q6AfterInitGheed": "71You're going after Andariel?\n\n... One of my wagon wheels is in need of repair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm needed.",
 "A1Q6AfterInitKashya": "81I can imagine a thousand different ways to kill Andariel. You need only choose one.",
 "A1Q6AfterInitWarriv": "72The mapmakers tell us the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\n\nOur way east is a line that runs through Andariel's stronghold, the Monastery.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturn2Kashya": "126Deckard Cain has important information about Andariel.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnAkara": "57You have done much to help us, but I sense that this has only fueled Andariel's fury. She will not stop until we are all dead.\n\nYou must kill Andariel before her army can gain the upper hand.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCain": "48It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to continue the pursuit.\n\nAncient lore has it that while Andariel was spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCharsi": "108If you are the hero that you seem to be, now is the time to prove it.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnGheed": "72Have you stumbled upon that Demon Queen, yet? I hear she's quite the beauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish go, that is.",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnWarriv": "90May I remind you that my caravan can only go east, if the Monastery is cleansed?",
 "A1Q6InitCain": "34It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not bode well for us, my friend.\n\nAncient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones.\n\nAndariel's presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. If this is true, then I fear for us all.\n\nYou must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of Hell and the way east lost forever.",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulAkara": "64Finally, we may rejoice!\n\nWe owe you a debt we can never repay. I only hope that in time we will be able to rebuild our Order.\n\nAll our thanks go with you, my friend.",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCain": "38This is a great victory indeed, but many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey, lending what assistance I can... \n\nRemember... Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert. I'm afraid that this nightmare will not end until you find what it is that he seeks.",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCharsi": "86You'll probably go east now... It was good to know you. I hope you'll come back if you ever need anything.",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulGheed": "100I'm going to party like it's 999!",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulKashya": "44Andariel's death brings about renewed life for us all. We mourn the loss of our dear Sisters, but at least now we can get on with our lives.\n\nI... may have misjudged you, outlander. You are a true hero and testament to the noble spirit which has inspired our Order for generations.\n\nFare well... my friend.",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulWarriv": "82The caravan is prepared. We may now journey eastward to Lut Gholein.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitAtma": "62The creature makes its lair in the tunnels beneath this city. He butchered my husband and son... I simply cannot bear to talk about it...",
 "A2Q1AfterInitCain": "48The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect their tombs, even after death.\n\nI have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about this.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitDrognan": "53Fara and I have been talking about the creature recently. From my studies, I have deduced that it is Radament the Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy that has for some reason left his tomb to prey on mortals.\n\nI'm doing some more research now. If you check back later, I may have some more insight as to his nature.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitElzix": "68I hear that the creature kills his victims in order to hack off their limbs! I guess that makes me a less likely candidate, eh?",
 "A2Q1AfterInitFara": "54I believe that the creature you refer to is one of the ancient Horadric mummies from the tombs that lie buried beneath the desert sands. It is unusual for one of his kind to be so far away from his resting place. I sense in this entity a restless and malevolent spirit.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGeglash": "77Hey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a hole into your skull with my thumb.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGreiz": "52I've personally found some of that devil's victims washed up out of the sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or a head, and their bodies have always been skinned.\n\nAt first the creature raided the town at night... That's how Atma lost her family. Now we've got him barricaded in the sewers.\n\nYou're safe up here on the surface, but every now and again some fool wants to be a hero and heads down to the waste tunnels with a pig-sticker.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitLysander": "94I hear that beast is after body parts. Does he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!",
 "A2Q1AfterInitMeshif": "63There are two entrances to the sewers, I believe. One of them is right near here, down by the water beneath the docks. I can see it from my ship, and you can bet I keep an eye on it every night.",
 "A2Q1AfterInitWarrivAct2": "84I've heard tales of walking corpses out in the desert at night, though I've never actually seen one.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnAtma": "83I am starting to have second thoughts about my request... I couldn't bear the thought of you losing your life on my behalf.\n\nPlease be careful.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnCain": "41The Horadric mummies were created to protect the tombs, but Radament is far from his burial chamber. Given the aberrations that have been witnessed lately, it comes as no surprise that even the ancient guardian spells have begun to unravel. Be wary of this as you venture farther into the desert.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnDrognan": "49I've just been reading something interesting about this sort of undead. Apparently, certain Horadric funereal priests altered the bodies of their dead mages with magical and surgical techniques -- often replacing body parts with those of animals.\n\nThis was thought to augment their powers, and raise their status in the afterlife.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnElzix": "69If you're going to fight that thing, use some common sense. Be knowledgeable about what harms the undead. Poison, for instance, will have little effect.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnFara": "68Drognan told me something interesting earlier today. It might explain why Radament is so restless, and it might have something to do with why he is stealing human body parts.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGeglash": "65Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of courage... Believe me, it doesn't help for long.\n\nDrinks, barkeep!",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGreiz": "69We've been meaning to send an organized group down there to kill that thing, but it would be dangerous. We just can't afford the chance of losing any men with all the trouble that's going on in the desert.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnLysander": "64Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, yes. Ooh, a foul creature...\n\nSome of my exploding potions should do quite nicely against him. They usually work well against the undead.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnMeshif": "55I noticed a rotting, human arm floating in the harbor this morning. I suspected foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't seem too concerned since there haven't been any folk reported missing lately.",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "90Death is not afraid of the living, but the living abhor death.",
 "A2Q1InitAtma": "50I don't expect this of you, but if you want to help me, I would be grateful.\n\nIn the sewers below our city, there lurks a horrid creature that hungers for human flesh. The creature has killed many, including my son and my husband.\n\nIf you destroy it, I will reward you. Please be careful though, that beast has taken enough from us already.\n\nThe sewer entrance is through the trap door just up the street.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulAtma": "50They say that the taste of vengeance is bittersweet, but I find it to my liking. \n\nIn addition to my undying gratitude, I have spoken on your behalf with the rest of the townspeople. The merchants have agreed to show their gratitude by offering their wares and services at lower rates.\n\nOh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. You'll find him in front of the palace.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulCain": "57If you haven't already, tell Atma that Radament is dead. It may help to ease the weight of her mourning.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulDrognan": "52From what you tell me, it would seem that Radament was bent on the task of reviving his own mummified corpse with the flesh of the living.\n\nThis is very unusual indeed. It takes an incredible magic power to alter the singular purpose of an undead mind.\n\nPerhaps there is a power at work here which is beyond my ken.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulElzix": "70We ran into one of those old tomb guardians when I ran with my bandits. I know they aren't easy foes to face, so you sure have my respect. Have you told Atma yet?",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulFara": "102As you have helped Atma and all of us, so shall I help you.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGeglash": "41Whoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?\n\nI've fallen off many a barstool and no one calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They might go so far as to say, 'Geglash, you've fallen!'",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGreiz": "76You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite a nice piece of work! If you ever need a job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to sign ya' up.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulLysander": "61Uh... Little of what I am able to hear is of any value. Radament's death, however, is news worth hearing. I'm sure Atma will be glad to hear of this.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulMeshif": "62Good job mate! At night out on my ship, I was often awakened by that fiend's awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "142Atma's been telling everyone what you've done for her.",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCapCain": "50The Viper Amulet you bear is actually the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!\n\nYes... You have an uncanny knack for finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of course, you'll have to use a Horadric Cube to combine the headpiece with the shaft.",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCubeCain": "40You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.\n\nTo do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube's transmute power.\n\nYou'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...\n\nSix gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword.\n\nYou may also transmute two quivers of crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts.\n\nI must leave it to you to discover other formulae.",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnScrollCain": "37Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a fortunate turn of events...\n\nAs the last living Horadrim, I alone have knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...\n\nThe Horadric Mages, after binding Baal within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off his Burial Chamber from the mortal realm. Those same Mages also crafted fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued them with the special power to open the Chamber's hidden door.\n\nAfter nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all the Horadric Staves into two parts - wooden shaft and metal headpiece - hiding them separately to safeguard them.\n\nThe Horadrim foresaw our current plight and designed the hiding places to reveal themselves to worthy heroes like you.\n\nCollect both parts of a Horadric Staff and unite them using a Horadric Cube. Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnStaveCain": "56The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my friend. You have discovered the shaft portion of a Horadric Staff.\n\nI trust you know how to use a Horadric Cube to unite the shaft with its headpiece.",
 "A2Q2SuccessfulStaffCain": "46Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.\n\nCarry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. Find within the Tomb the chamber whose floor is inset with the Circle of Seven Symbols.\n\nPlace the Staff into the receptacle you find there. That will open the secret passage into Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.\n\nBut, be prepared for a fight - you'll likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy Baal.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitAtma": "121Drognan, the wizard, will have some idea as to what is happening.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitCain": "62Drognan may have some advice on this matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with him myself.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitDrognan": "77I've been researching this lengthy eclipse and I believe it to be the work of Claw Vipers.\n\nFind their temple beneath the desert sands and you may find the source of this curse.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitElzix": "65Two men arrived late last night bearing a story about evil magic. They said they saw a gathering of giant snake creatures performing some arcane ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men of the desert.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitFara": "70This unnatural nightfall is no doubt caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might know what we are dealing with.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGeglash": "100This whole place is one big ale fog.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGreiz": "71This midday darkness reeks of foul magic! My men and I are trying to keep the peace, but this kind of thing really scares people.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitJerhyn": "110My astrologers failed to predict this eclipse. You should seek Drognan's advice.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitLysander": "65Claw Vipers! This outer darkness mirrors the inner blackness of their souls. It is they who have eclipsed the sun, I'll wager. They are a venomous band.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitMeshif": "76This permanent darkness is very unsettling. Hmmm... It would make navigation by stars easier for me, though.",
 "A2Q3AfterInitWarrivAct2": "72The sun has grown disgusted with the terrible deeds it must shine upon each day. Damnation is upon us all.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnAtma": "80I was going to go to bed, but then I realized that I have no idea what time it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for all I know.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57The source of this spell is probably a magical altar. It will not be enough to kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the spell you must destroy the altar.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnDrognan": "51I've discovered a reference to a similar eclipse several hundred years ago. It says that some desert-dwelling snake demons had erected an evil altar, which caused the sun to go black.\n\nPerhaps we are dealing with something similar here. Look for an altar in the Claw Viper temple.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnElzix": "94I usually charge for rooms by the night.\n\nBut I may have to soon change that.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnFara": "77The Claw Vipers practice evil magic. They have also been known to kidnap travelers and sacrifice them to their dark gods.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGeglash": "49It's strange when the morning after the night before... is still the same night.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGreiz": "73Don't worry! My men and I have an iron grip on this town. If those cursed Claw Vipers are plotting anything against us, we'll be prepared for 'em.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnJerhyn": "130This eclipse is a definite manifestation of evil.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnLysander": "82Well... I don't know much about the habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. Drognan will probably know something about the nature of the magic at work.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnMeshif": "105I've had about enough of this darkness. I don't even know what day it is anymore.",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "73The calculated coldness of the reptilian brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny adversaries.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulAtma": "132You have done well to restore light to our world.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulCain": "48I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and I sense that he is becoming more and more agitated by something. You should try to talk to him again.\n\nIf he still won't take you into his confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit more. I gather that his respect for you is growing.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulDrognan": "69You did well in destroying the Claw Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun returned to its former glory.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulElzix": "74Ahh... It takes but one eye to revel in the beauty of our restored sun.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulFara": "87Drognan seems to have taken you into his confidence. This is good, for you will benefit from his wisdom.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulGeglash": "60So, this is daylight... It's over-rated.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulGreiz": "219I'm glad that's over with!",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulJerhyn": "96The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm beginning to like you, traveler.",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulLysander": "69Ahhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical artifacts. Did you happen to find one in their temple?",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulMeshif": "130So... Did you plunder any booty?",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "80With renewed daylight, one may gather the wits that were scattered about like restrictive undergarments in the darkness.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitAtma": "75Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds awful! Even if you find a way into it, what makes you think you'll be able to leave again?",
 "A2Q4AfterInitCain": "45I very much doubt that Horazon still lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed great power and influence over demons, but even that may not have been enough in the end. One of his notoriety cannot easily remove himself from the vengeful reach of Hell.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitDrognan": "42Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage clan. Horazon used the knowledge of the Vizjerei to summon and control demons from Hell.\n\nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon feared that the Lords of Hell would punish him for enslaving their brethren. Thus, the Summoner created for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.\n\nHe believed that his Sanctuary would not only protect him from Hell's vengeance, but also allow him to continue his studies free from the ravages of time and disease.\n\nHorazon had crafted many wondrous scrying devices through which he observed the events of the world outside. It is certain that he took careful study of Tal Rasha's imprisonment and recorded the location of his forgotten Tomb.\n\nThe Arcane Sanctuary was believed to have been constructed here in Lut Gholein. An entrance may be hidden somewhere in the palace, as that building is very old, and was once a Vizjerei fortress.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitElzix": "62An 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the palace? I'd heard that there were some underground cellar levels that Jerhyn used as chambers for his treasure and such, but no Arcane Sanctuary.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitFara": "46Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He believed that he could bend Evil forces to his will. What he didn't know was that Evil uses man, not the reverse.\n\nThe Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol of man's ability to triumph over other worldly forces. The Church of Light, however, cites him as an example of man's folly.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGeglash": "60Look, look... I'm just about as tough and arrogant as they come, but you'd never catch me trying to tame a demon for a pet. That's just asking for a lot of trouble.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGreiz": "89The only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the harem girls that have been hiding there since the troubles began.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitJerhyn": "44When the troubles began here, I allowed the terrified Harem guilds to join me within the safety of the palace. All was fine, until one night...\n\nScreams echoed up the stairwells from the harem. My guards arrived to find the poor girls being slaughtered by a merciless band of hell-spawned demons. My brave guardsmen tried to push the demons back into the mysterious rift from which they came.\n\nEver since, my men have fought a losing battle. Demons have continued to pour through the rift into the palace. Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his mercenaries to help protect the rest of my fair city.\n\nDrognan believes that the Arcane Sanctuary lies buried underneath this palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.\n\nMy palace is open to you now... Take care.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitLysander": "49Horazon found it necessary to lock himself up for all time, just to protect himself from those angry demons. Such is the fate of one who practices the summoning arts... that, or eternal damnation. There's old summoners and bold summoners, but no old, bold summoners.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitMeshif": "57Ahh... The legend of Horazon is an old one, especially around these parts. You wouldn't believe the feats and strange events that are attributed to him.",
 "A2Q4AfterInitWarrivAct2": "73A careful caravan gives wide berth to sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, let him remain so.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnAtma": "87So you've been in the palace, have you? Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that place locked up so tight?",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnCain": "51I've been thinking about the problems in Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has occurred to you as well...\n\nIf those cellar passageways lead to the Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where the demons came from. Horazon's haven must have been breached!",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnDrognan": "63I am certain that you will find the information you need when you find Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it quickly, for Diablo may be getting closer to freeing his brother as we speak.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnElzix": "63I understand that you've been talking to Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first in a long while... since the trouble began, actually.\n\nDo us a favor and try to find out what's got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnFara": "57Even a sanctuary such as Horazon's can be breached by the tentacles of Evil. Such a haven could have become a chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be wary of what you may unleash!",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGeglash": "49All my years of brawling, of pummeling both the unsuspecting and the deserving, have yielded two insights. You can either fight or you can run. All other strategies are variations of these.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGreiz": "61What's got you so occupied in the palace? Don't tell me you're finding the Harems more compelling than killing demons? That would be out of character for one such as yourself.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnJerhyn": "48There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, I believe... who visited me almost a year ago. He was very interested in the history of this site, and he seemed particularly fascinated with the palace architecture.\n\nI gave him a tour. When he found the ancient seals over a passageway in the cellar, he became very agitated. He asked for some time alone to study them, and I granted it.\n\nShortly after, he left with no further word and I never saw him again. Odd... Don't you think?",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnLysander": "68Huh? The horizon is always out of reach, you should know that. Oh, Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh.\n\nYes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, but... total lunatic.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnMeshif": "77So... Now that you're such a pal of Jerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can set sail one of these days? I'm running out of patience.",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "87Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt you with dung if you mock it.",
 "A2Q4InitDrognan": "41I've been researching the old records, trying to find the location of Tal Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found the Tomb, itself, I may have a good lead for you.\n\nThe great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere around here. He was a powerful spellcaster and kept demons as slaves within the Sanctuary. He kept a close eye on great events, too -- such as the imprisonment of Baal within Tal Rasha's Tomb.\n\nIf you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, I'm sure that it would hold some clue as to the Tomb's location. Though I doubt Horazon is still alive, you must proceed with caution. There's no telling what could be waiting inside.\n\nWhen I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, he asked that I send you to him. Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance or the like.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulAtma": "62Oh, those poor women! Will the slaughter never end? Thank you once again for protecting our city.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulCain": "57You must move quickly now, friend, for Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal Rasha before he frees the Lord of Destruction.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulDrognan": "55You have found Horazon's Journal. Excellent... But, I must caution you.\n\nThe mark of the True Tomb of Tal Rasha, is sought, if not already known, by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the implications of that.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulElzix": "71News of the tragedy in the palace is spreading fast. How awful! And to think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn and his guards were in there playing with the harem girls.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulFara": "64Faith is stronger than any armor. The shield will protect the body, but Faith will strengthen the courageous heart.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGeglash": "60Hah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the palace. I would've saved those girls and kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits o' Hell!",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGriez": "59Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! The palace guards have been fighting off demons from the cellar. How could that happen without my knowledge?",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulJerhyn": "62I thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also glad that you found something you were looking for. The journal should help you find the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to get there before Diablo.\n\nGo now. And good luck.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulLysander": "55Horazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, well... Glad you found it. Such a shame about those poor harem girls, huh? I shall miss them deeply... I mean their conversations, of course.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulMeshif": "52So... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. Well... I guess I can see why he wanted me to stay, though... I'm just glad it didn't come to that. Now he tells me to wait some more, in case you need to get out of here.\n\nWell, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll mention me in the epic ballads, eh?",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulNarrator": "37Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will find it through the Portal. But know that the glowing glyphs recorded here in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs of the six False Tombs.\n\nThe missing Seventh Sign marks the Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim he might be called the foremost.\n\nIt was a shining - but brief - moment for the Mage Clans when they set aside their differences and worked together against the common enemy.\n\nThe Horadrim relentlessly pursued the Three across the desolate Empires of the East, and even into the uncharted lands of the West, leaving the Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.\n\nPresuming the Three to be vanquished, the Horadrim's unstable fellowship began to dissipate. Abandoning their sacred charge to safeguard the three Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans began to squabble amongst each other over petty differences.\n\nTheir conflicts not only dissolved their brotherhood, but strengthened the Evils which they had buried beneath the cold earth.",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "67Well, the news going around town is very unsettling. Apparently, we were in more danger than anyone thought.\n\nGood work friend... you may have saved all our skins.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnAtma": "105You always seem to find the worst trouble. I don't know how you handle it.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnCain": "45The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them.\n\nYou know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to you.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnDrognan": "47Yes... The man you speak of sounds like the mage who came here many months ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo in the passages beneath Tristram.\n\nNo doubt the fool wandered into Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever was left of his ravaged mind. He is beyond salvation. \n\nIt is possible that the fool has been possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If that's true, then you'd better put an end to his tortured existence.\n\nOnce done, I believe the demons who were summoned and imprisoned within the Sanctuary will cease to exist as well.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnElzix": "106Ugh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.\n\nJust kill him and get on with your business.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnFara": "63Hmmm... That doesn't sound like Horazon. I'll agree that he may have gone mad, but from what you tell me, I don't think that's the case. Talk to Drognan... he may know more than I.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGeglash": "38So! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be surprised if he wasn't. All those centuries without ale would drive anyone to drink... but then you couldn't drink. And that would drive you to drink... Hah?... What was the question?",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGreiz": "89That guy really talks like that? Sounds like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy or that's some impostor.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnJerhyn": "57The man you describe is probably not Horazon.\n\nHe sounds like the very mage who came around here a while ago. He was very curious about this palace and seemed especially interested in the seal on the passageway in the cellar. He left shortly after that. I wonder how he got down there? The seal was never broken...\n\nThat mage spoke a great deal to Drognan. Why don't you ask him about it?",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnLysander": "57Ah, yes. I remember. There was a... fellow around here many months ago who asked almost as many questions about Horazon as you.\n\nSo... He discovered enough to assume Horazon's place in the Arcane Sanctuary, huh? What a fool!",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnMeshif": "72Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well aware of the phenomenon of a false Horazon.\n\nSorry, just a little joke.",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "99There's nothing more dreadful than a powerful being driven by a frayed mind.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulAtma": "89You're more the hero than I could have dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us after all.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulCain": "48I hope that this false Summoner found peace in death. Unfortunately, it is more likely that he will be dragged down into Hell by the demons he was bound to.\n\nLet this be a lesson to you... Demonic magic is a quick path, but its powers are seductive and deadly.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulDrognan": "83Larger forces are moving inexorably towards us. You must now make haste to the Tombs.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulElzix": "65You make me long for the days of glory. When I had both hands, both eyes and more of a foot...",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulFara": "74I feel no pity for that would-be Summoner. His terrible ambition for demonic power was his undoing. You merely hastened the inevitable.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGeglash": "60The way I see it... Well, it's all pretty blurry.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGreiz": "76So, Horazon's been dead for some time. I take it you at least found what you were looking for.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulJerhyn": "63The demonic force that was emanating from the corrupted Sanctuary has dissipated. I thank you greatly for your help. Now, we can look to rebuilding our lives.\n\nAll will be for nothing, though, if you do not stop the greater Evil which is rapidly gaining ground.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulLysander": "103Huhhh... Such is always the fate of those who meddle with evil.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulMeshif": "100Well! You've got what you're after. Now get a move on before it's too late.",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "84I guess you'll be heading to the Tombs now? I hear that they're in the deepest desert regions.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitAtma": "67I've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal Rasha, but I thought they were just old tales meant to scare young children.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitCain": "57Diablo nears his goal. We have little time to lose.\n\nRemember, my friend, that Andariel gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. It would be prudent to assume that the other Evils will attempt to aid their master as well.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitDrognan": "55Tal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the desert among six others. Tal Rasha's symbol marks the True Tomb. If you want to know what that symbol is, you should be able to find it within the legendary Arcane Sanctuary.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitElzix": "59So... You're going to search for the Seven Tombs, huh? Don't you know that they're just desert legends passed between merchants and travelers? No one really believes that they exist.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitFara": "57Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies imprisoned within his tomb, forever struggling to keep the Lord of Destruction bound. His was a selfless act, although perhaps foolhardy.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGeglash": "59Ohh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... But... umm... I don't like all that living dead stuff.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGreiz": "106If you're going into the deep desert, why not hire a few of my men to watch your back?",
 "A2Q6AfterInitJerhyn": "53It is well-known that there are seven great Horadric tombs hidden beneath the sands in the furthest reaches of the desert. One of them surely must be Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's exact location.\n\nOf course, Diablo is searching for the Tomb as well... No one can guess as to what terrors he has unleashed in his search.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitLysander": "56When Tal Rasha chose to embody the spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to wrestle eternally against the will of the greater Evil. Look around you and ask yourself, 'Has the battle been won or lost?'",
 "A2Q6AfterInitMeshif": "84I'm sorry, I can't help you much here. Now, if the tombs were across the ocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.",
 "A2Q6AfterInitWarrivAct2": "61Be very careful, my friend. I think I've seen enough recently not to doubt that these Tombs exist. And if they do, they're most certainly guarded by terrible creatures.",
 "A2Q6InitJerhyn": "45I have heard of your many deeds of skill and bravery. I feel I can trust you with something I have been hesitant to speak of...\n\nDrognan and I have concluded that the Dark Wanderer who passed through here recently was Diablo, himself! Drognan believes that Diablo is searching the desert for the secret tomb where the great Horadric mage, Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.\n\nYou must find Diablo and put an end to the terrible evil that has fallen upon our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to have some helpful advice for you as to how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.\n\nIt may take you quite some time to find The Tomb. May you be ready when you do.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulAtma": "64You have proven to be the greatest of heroes, and I am honored to call you friend. Thank you for bringing peace to our lives again.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulCain": "39The Archangel Tyrael was the one who gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim two hundred and sixty years ago.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the forces of Heaven to so directly interfere with man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to act of his own volition. We have never been able to discern why.\n\nPerhaps, he goes against the consensus of Heaven because he doubts our ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, he sees more threat than his peers.\n\nWhere the actions of Hell often seem straightforwardly bent on destruction, the motives of Heaven are unfathomable.\n\nNow make haste... Both Diablo and Baal must be stopped before they join with their brother, Mephisto. If the three Prime Evils unite once again, the world as we know it will be no more.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulDrognan": "51This is a serious setback... It is most unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been consumed by Baal's destructive influence. There are many secrets known to the Horadrim, which could be used by Baal against us.\n\nYou must travel east by sea to Kurast and stop Diablo and Baal before they free their eldest brother, Mephisto.\n\nHahh... The lands of the eastern Empire are not the same as they used to be. There has been little word for some time.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. Go quickly, my friend. May the fates smile on you.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulElzix": "71I heard that Diablo has managed to best you, at least for the time being. I hope you catch up with him soon, and send him back to Hell for good!",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulFara": "46This is terrible news! Baal is in possession of one of mankind's most powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror guides his path. They must be stopped, for I am sure they mean to free their elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the corrupted city of Kurast.\n\nI fear you are walking into a great evil, but your faith can save you. May you walk in the light always.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGeglash": "54You're an inspiration! And such a hero that it makes me look twice as bad...\n\nAhh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some glory for us little guys, huh?",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGreiz": "51I've heard that your foe got away from you this time. Well, look at it this way... you've got the demons on the run. If you're going to be leaving, then... Well, thanks for your help.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulJerhyn": "47You have done very well. Few could have come this far, let alone discover the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded your grasp. This is most unfortunate...\n\nIf you wish to travel East, I have authorized Meshif to give you passage by sea. I imagine he should be very anxious to leave by now.\n\nGood luck on your quest, and thank you again for saving my beloved city. You will always be welcome in Lut Gholein, my friend.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulLysander": "70I'm sorry things didn't turn out as you had hoped. Go and remember us fondly. You know, you bothered me far less than most.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulMeshif": "82Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to Kurast. I haven't been there for several years, but rumor has it that things are pretty grim.",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "68Never fear, my friend. You did the best you could.\n\nI suspect that Diablo and Baal are now heading east, towards Kurast. You'll find them... I know you will.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitAlkor": "73The Black Book contains powerful secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, long eclipsed by Zakarum.\n\nI should warn you. The Black Book is much sought after by both good and evil. Be wary.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitAsheara": "102Many things can be found in the city of Kurast. The book may be there.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitCainAct3": "72The Black Book is a powerful source of information. The Zakarum will do everything in their power to stop you from obtaining it.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitHratli": "54We have long sought the Black Book of Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you find it, take it to Alkor.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitMeshifAct3": "73Oh. No one really believes that the Black Book exists. It's just a symbol of Zakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitNatalya": "81I've heard of the Black Book. My Order's code is based on many of its passages. If you find it, I will be greatly impressed.",
 "A3Q1AfterInitOrmus": "62The Children of Zakarum believe that the Black Book is filled with blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book may contain the secrets to our ultimate redemption.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnAlkor": "104Did I neglect to mention that the book contains useful information about the Prime Evils?",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnAsheara": "68I believe I can trust you now.\n\nWhen you first arrived, I suspected you a spy for the Zakarum, the false religion whose faithful are now under the sway of a mysterious power. They've made a mockery of the Old Religion of Skatsim.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnCainAct3": "81I heard that there are ruined temples in Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black Book in one of them.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnHratli": "62Not getting much help?\n\nYou know, people are like rugs. Hang them out a window and shake 'em a couple times. You'll be surprised how much dirt comes out.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "56Kurast was once the greatest city in the world. Now it is hard to tell where the jungle stops and the city begins. The jungle grows rampant on the soil enriched by the blood of my fellow citizens.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnNatalya": "105I hope you find the Black Book soon. I could use something to read while I wait for my orders.",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnOrmus": "55Even if you find the sacred Book, you must still traverse the jungle of meaning within it. That journey could prove to be far more perilous.",
 "A3Q1InitAlkor": "56It pains me to waste time with you, so I'll get right to the point.\n\nThere is a very special book which you must find for me. It was written long ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who studied Skatsimi magic and the effects of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. The Black Book was lost when the Children of Zakarum took over this land.\n\nNow, you must reclaim it without delay! Its knowledge may aid us in this dark time ahead.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulAlkor": "83You have found the Book! It should give all of us here some insight into the nature of the Prime Evils...\n\nAh, but as for you...",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulAsheara": "135The Iron Wolves are very impressed by your skills.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulCainAct3": "86You have found a source of information powerful enough to turn the tide against the Zakarum.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulHratli": "74We have the Book. Now we must see if we can bear its revelations.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "75Thank all that's holy. You've returned with the Black Book! Maybe now you can put an end to the Evil that has destroyed my homeland.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulNatalya": "89So, you've returned with the Book. You surprise me. You must be very resourceful.",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulOrmus": "70Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape of our future.",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnBrainCain": "58This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain knows Mephisto's weakness.\n\nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Heart, and the Flail.",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnEyeCain": "52Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto.\n\nPlace the Eye in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnFlailCain": "46Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal the way to Mephisto.\n\nPlace it into the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute them to carry out Khalim's Will.",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnHeartCain": "61You have found Khalim's Heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto!\n\nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Brain, and the Flail.",
 "A3Q2InitCain": "33Never forget that your ultimate purpose here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian Tower that is located within the Temple City of Travincal.\n\nKnow this, friend. The only way to gain entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy the artifact known as the Compelling Orb.\n\nMephisto used this device to control the Zakarum Priests and their followers. The Orb can only be destroyed with an ancient flail imbued with the spirit of the one incorruptible priest.\n\nSoon after his imprisonment, Mephisto worked his evil corruption on the Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the Que-Hegan of the High Council.\n\nMephisto directed the other Council priests to slay and dismember Khalim and then scatter his remains across the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, eventually becoming the embodiment of Mephisto here on the mortal plane.\n\nThe corrupted High Council fashioned an Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to hide the lair of their master from mortals.\n\nYour task is to collect the scattered relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his relics.\n\nOnce this is accomplished, you must destroy the Compelling Orb with Khalim's Will to open the way into the corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.",
 "A3Q2SuccessfulCain": "54Masterfully done, hero! You have crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to destroy the Compelling Orb and open the way to Mephisto. \n\nMay the true Light guide your way.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitAlkor": "66Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? Well, allow me to reduce your ignorance on the subject.\n\nThe Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a religious artifact greatly valued by the Old Religion, Skatsim.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitAsheara": "107The Gidbinn will reinforce the enchantments that protect the dockside from the evil that infests Kurast.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitCainAct3": "55I've done some research on the Taan mage-clan, and it seems that most of their magical studies were focused on Skatsimi rites.\n\nIf anyone is qualified to use the powers of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitHratli": "54As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the possession of the Children of Light. They do not wish it to fall into the hands of those who can restore its powers.\n\nYou may not believe it, but Ormus is the one who can use the Gidbinn to protect us.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitMeshifAct3": "66The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is reputed to have great powers.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitNatalya": "73Don't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. Though it is only a small dagger, it holds tremendous power when in the hands of a true Skatsimi mage.",
 "A3Q3AfterInitOrmus": "64Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact aid an unbeliever like you?",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnAlkor": "70Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests placed great power within the small blade. Power enough to repel this terrible jungle-curse which encroaches on our sanctuary.",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnAsheara": "145I'm certain that the Gidbinn is very closely guarded.",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnCainAct3": "75Since you haven't come across the Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper in the jungle nearer Kurast.",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnHratli": "70Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will use it to strengthen the protective barrier around the dockside.",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "67The jungle is like nothing you've ever seen before. Imagine Paradise festering like a wound... then bursting!",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnNatalya": "97You'd best get back out there and find that blade. The jungle creeps further into this camp by the hour.",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnOrmus": "83If we are to have peace from the shadow, you must find the weapon which will destroy the Light.",
 "A3Q3InitHratli": "45As I told you before, I placed an enchantment upon the dockside in order to keep the demons at bay. But lately, the enchantment seems to be weakening.\n\nIf memory serves me correctly, there is a holy Skatsimi blade that could revitalize the enchantment. The blade is called the Gidbinn.\n\nFind it, and our sanctuary here will remain safe.",
 "A3Q3RewardOrmus": "101This magic ring does me no good.\n\nHere... Wear it proudly!",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulAlkor": "77Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade from right under Zakarum's nose! This is a great day, indeed!",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulAsheara": "99Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are needed to guard the dockside, some of them have volunteered to accompany you free of charge.",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulCainAct3": "62Who could have foreseen that the Old Religion would play such an effective role in our war against the Three? Again, your efforts amaze me, my friend.",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulHratli": "80The Gidbinn's magic can only be channeled through Ormus.\n\nTake it to him. He has the necessary knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi magics.",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "79With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will grant us revenge upon the powers that ravaged this land.",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulNatalya": "67You are truly amazing, stranger. There are precious few items in the world that would tempt me to go up against the Children of Zakarum.",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulOrmus": "41You have done well, noble hero. Ormus congratulates you. The old spirits of Skatsim will watch over you for returning their sacred blade.\n\nNow, after all these years, Ormus will once again use his powers to protect the innocent from the shadow. The spell that protects the dockside shall now be reinforced.",
 "A3Q4AfterInitAlkor": "73Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank you, my friend. \n\nBusy yourself while I experiment with the ashes within it. Then, return and see what I have made for you.",
 "A3Q4AfterInitHratli": "50Ku Y'leh was a powerful sage who was rumored to have brewed a potion of immortality. In an ironic twist of fate, he was murdered before his potent elixir could take effect.",
 "A3Q4AfterInitNatalya": "78Don't tell me you believe in all of that 'life after death' nonsense. You should be more concerned with avoiding death than making plans for after it finds you.",
 "A3Q4AfterInitOrmus": "51Ku Y'leh, in searching for immortal youth, found only an early death. His apprentices, seeking to live forever, burned his body in order to derive benefit from his ashes.",
 "A3Q4Init1Asheara": "160Only Deckard Cain can make sense of this.",
 "A3Q4Init1CainAct3": "53Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he collected an odd assortment of such small statues.\n\nI would show him your figurine. ",
 "A3Q4Init2MeshifAct3": "73Praise you! That jade figurine will complete the set I was collecting.\n\nHere! I've had this statuette of a golden bird for years, but I consider it a fair exchange.",
 "A3Q4Init2Natalya": "89I'm having fun just watching you run from place to place searching for a Golden Bird. Some hero you are.",
 "A3Q4Init3Asheara": "96Such a beautiful statuette... But, you'd think it would've been better cared for. There's a compartment here that's full o' dust.",
 "A3Q4Init3CainAct3": "47I've read legends about a sage named Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of life beyond death.\n\nIf I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.",
 "A3Q4Init3Hratli": "134You will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to Alkor.",
 "A3Q4SuccessfulAlkor": "120From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed for you a potion.",
 "A3Q4SuccessfulCainAct3": "63So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all along. I wonder if he knows what he gave up for that jade figurine.",
 "A3Q4SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "94Immortality is definitely not for me.\n\nCan you imagine having to wake up every night just to piss for the next thousand years?",
 "A3Q4SuccessfulNatalya": "67I must admit, your foolish quest made little sense to me. But now I see the value of your actions. I believe you do possess great wisdom.",
 "A3Q4SuccessfulOrmus": "54Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh. That venerable sage forgot that there is no life beyond death. There is only life.\n\nOnce prolonged unnaturally, it can become a living hell.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitAlkor": "84The Black Book contains some vague prophecies regarding this undertaking. I'm not so sure it will turn out well for you.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitAlkorVA": "90I am but a potion dealer and an avid reader of occult books. What do I know of the Travincal?",
 "A3Q5AfterInitAsheara": "89The Children of Zakarum who guard the Tower square can be killed, but their numbers are vast. You must destroy their Council.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitAshearaVA": "105There are many zealots among the followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult to get past them.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3": "63Ormus tells me that the Council is comprised of tremendously powerful priests. It will be difficult to best them.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3VA": "93The Temple City is well guarded. You'd best keep your wits about you.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitHratli": "104Remember. You can always find sanctuary here with us.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitHratliVA": "75This has been a trying time for all of us, but I sense this nightmare is coming to an end.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3": "68There is only one way to the Temple City. You will have to cross many rivers and streams, but you'll find it. A great tower stands at its center.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3VA": "113It has been said that Ormus speaks most clearly when his ideas are utterly mad.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitNatalya": "100You are incredibly brave to venture into the lion's den. I wish you luck.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitNatalyaVA": "95Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their fanaticism is their greatest weapon.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitOrmus": "54You must know that the Guardian Tower in the Temple City was built by the Horadrim for one purpose - to hold Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, you may enter the Tower.",
 "A3Q5AfterInitOrmusVA": "54You must know that the Guardian Tower in the Temple City was built by the Horadrim for one purpose -  to hold Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, you may enter the Tower.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkor": "111Kill as many as you can. I have a morbid love of excess.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkorVA": "91If only we could have found the Black Book. I feel as though a malevolent hand has led us away from it.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnAsheara": "161The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready to aid you.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnAshearaVA": "139Things are getting wilder than Ladies Night at the Slippery Fist.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnCainAct3": "81Sankekur may be using a Compelling Orb to control the minds of the Children of Zakarum.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnHratli": "65The followers of Zakarum demand complete allegiance to their creed. They have slaughtered many of their own for minor grievances.\n\nThey will not hesitate to kill you.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnHratliVA": "75After having served Mephisto all these years, the Council must be twisted by hatred and evil.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "110Within the Temple City is a courtyard. The Council resides there.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA": "107I have heard rumors that the Prime Evils are here seeking their Brother.",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalya": "80I respect your need to do this. Honor demands that you see this through. Yet your chances are so slim...",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalyaVA": "80I respect your need to do this. Honor demands that you see this through. Yet your chances are so slim...",
 "A3Q5EarlyReturnOrmus": "49If you die on this quest, I will commemorate your sacrifice in an epic poem. You will not need a potion to achieve immortality. Ormus' words will do that.",
 "A3Q5InitOrmus": "36You have done well, my friend. Your courage and valor are an inspiration to us all.\n\nBut now the time has come to face those responsible for the evil that has stifled our land. You must destroy the High Council of Zakarum!\n\nLong ago, these elders were charged with the stewardship of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned within the Guardian Tower.\n\nThrough the generations, these pious men slowly fell more and more under the sway of Mephisto's malevolent power and the Council became an evil mockery of its former glory. \n\nIt is Mephisto's Hatred that has corrupted Zakarum and turned its devout followers into paranoid fanatics. That is why you must travel to the Temple City of Travincal and slay the Council.\n\nOnce they are gone, Mephisto's hold over this land and its people will be broken!",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulAlkor": "91You've accomplished the impossible! By killing the Council, the curse of Zakarum will be lifted and our land will be free!\n\nOh. Thank you!",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulAsheara": "125The sun has set on the Religion of Light.",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulCainAct3": "48Ridding Kurast of the Council of Zakarum was essential. Still, there is more you must do. The Compelling Orb, too, must be destroyed.\n\nDiablo and Baal must be close to finding their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've no time to waste.",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulHratli": "68The followers of Zakarum lacked all sense of moderation. The collapse of their tainted religion gives me hope.",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "76It seems the jungle is already dying back. You've broken the curse, my friend! May the Light bless you!",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulNatalya": "88I can hardly believe you did it. Your power blankets you like a shining aura.",
 "A3Q5SuccessfulOrmus": "40Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You have broken the long, dark reign of Zakarum and delivered the first paralyzing blow against the Three.\n\nYet still, the true test lies ahead. For he whom the Council guarded still lives within the Blackened Tower.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitAlkor": "90The hidden ways of the Tower are long forgotten. Though it is rumored to have been built as far below the ground as above it.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitAlkorVA": "114We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure of his Brothers' whereabouts.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitAsheara": "60I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a scouting mission into the jungle near the Temple City... They encountered two cloaked men who attacked them with horrifying powers.\n\nMy men barely survived. I have to assume that the two strangers are Diablo and Baal.\n\nYou'd better hurry. They're close to finding their brother.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitAshearaVA": "93Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in Travincal. The Evil is still strong there.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3": "116You must reach Mephisto before his brothers do.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3VA": "50The ancient Horadrim always feared that the Three would escape their prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, the last of their Order, have seen it come to pass.\n\nYou are the only one who can prevent this, my friend. The final hour draws near.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitHratli": "43Mephisto, along with Baal, was originally captured in the desert near Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the Brothers together was far too dangerous.\n\nThe Horadrim built the Guardian Tower to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came to power in this land, it took over the Temple City without paying any heed to what was locked within the Tower.\n\nAnd it became their doom.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitHratliVA": "73I hear there is a little family reunion about to take place in Kurast. The Three brothers draw close.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3": "66Be careful when you return to the Tower. Though many of the followers of Zakarum have fled, there's no telling what horrors still lurk inside it.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3VA": "116Move quickly, my friend, and end this curse once and for all!",
 "A3Q6AfterInitNatalya": "75Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't give in to your hatred. That is his greatest weapon against you.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitNatalyaVA": "75Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't give in to your hatred. That is his greatest weapon against you.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitOrmus": "52Make haste! Though the Three are sure to reunite, it is uncertain as to what they have planned once they do.\n\nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are mighty, no mortal can stand alone against the power of the Prime Evils.",
 "A3Q6AfterInitOrmusVA": "52Make haste! Though the Three are sure to reunite, it is uncertain as to what they have planned once they do.\n\nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are mighty, no mortal can stand alone against the power of the Prime Evils.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkor": "68Well, the good news is that events are unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. The bad news is that the story ends in our utter ruin!",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkorVA": "80I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of elixir preclude me from answering.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnAsheara": "80The sudden reduction in our ranks makes us eager to destroy Diablo and his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron Wolves!",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnAshearaVA": "200We will fight to the death.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3": "96Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3VA": "96Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnHratli": "58Why build a Tower to place the beast below ground? At times I believe the Horadrim lacked common sense.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnHratliVA": "106Shouldn't you be running frantically up and down stairs about now?",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "110I ought to return to the ship. We may have to sail from here very quickly.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA": "110I ought to return to the ship. We may have to sail from here very quickly.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalya": "55Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the most powerful mortal in the world. He controls thousands of fanatical worshippers and embodies the Lord of Hatred, himself. His death will be no easy task.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalyaVA": "55Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the most powerful mortal in the world. He controls thousands of fanatical worshippers and embodies the Lord of Hatred himself. His death will be no easy task.",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmus": "59I understand that the great Patriarch of Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies Mephisto.\n\nYou must overcome Hatred lest Terror and Destruction claim us all!",
 "A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmusVA": "77I am loath to describe what will happen if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.",
 "A3Q6InitOrmus": "53Diablo and Baal have surely found the Temple City by now. They seek to free their Brother, Mephisto, who was imprisoned by the Horadrim in the Temple's Guardian Tower.\n\nYou must reach him before his Brothers do and prevent them from releasing Hatred upon the world.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulAlkor": "71Your news is great indeed. You have saved us all. I would smile, but I'm afraid my face might collapse.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulAsheara": "65Well done, my friend. You are a great champion of Order. Please, consider yourself an honorary Iron Wolf.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulCainAct3": "42Our faith in you was well deserved. But Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it is likely that Baal followed him there.\n\nEnter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost. Only then will our world be saved!",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulHratli": "121It looks like you're going to Hell before me.\n\nPut in a good word.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "70Ahh... Now, Kurast can begin the task of rekindling its former glory... I thank you.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulNatalya": "55Word is spreading fast that you killed Mephisto. I'd be honored to fight beside you in Hell, but I've just received my mission orders.\n\nI'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands of the North, but I can't tell you why. With luck, our paths will cross again. Farewell.",
 "A3Q6SuccessfulOrmus": "48You have defeated a Prime Evil in combat. Ormus is impressed beyond words. But staying here will not end this conflict.\n\nYou must enter the Infernal Gate and stop Diablo once and for all.",
 "A4Q1AfterInitCain": "54Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual the Fallen? He must have great faith in your abilities!\n\nI trust you know what you're doing... Be careful. You're our last hope.",
 "A4Q1AfterInitTyrael": "59Though Izual no longer carries the Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may still possess great strength and power within his new form.\n\nAlso, he may not be able to tell friend from foe while in his present state. If you find him, he will almost certainly be hostile.\n\nProceed with the utmost caution.",
 "A4Q1EarlyReturnCain": "83Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, eh?\n\nYou'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.",
 "A4Q1EarlyReturnTyrael": "75You mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual must be put to rest, but Diablo still lurks within this realm.\n\nGo now... Hurry!",
 "A4Q1InitTyrael": "42There is a dark, tortured soul who was trapped within this forsaken realm long ago. He was called Izual by mortal men, and in ages past he was my most trusted Lieutenant.\n\nYet, against my wishes he led an ill-fated assault upon the fiery Hellforge, itself.\n\nDespite his valor and strength, Izual was captured by the Prime Evils and twisted by their perverse power. They forced him to betray his own kind and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets.\n\nHe became a corrupt shadow of his former self - a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor Hell.\n\nFor his transgressions, Izual's spirit was bound within the form of a terrible creature which was summoned from the Abyss. His maddened spirit has resided within that tortured husk for many ages now.\n\nIt seems to me that he has suffered long enough. I implore you, hero, find Izual and release him from his cruel imprisonment.\n\nPut an end to his guilt and suffering.",
 "A4Q1SuccessfulCain": "68You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is imperative that you find and stop Diablo!\n\nYou should speak of this with Tyrael. He will know what to make of this.",
 "A4Q1SuccessfulIzual": "47Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me!\n\nYou see, it was I who told Diablo and his Brothers about the Soulstones and how to corrupt them. It was I who helped the Prime Evils mastermind their own exile to your world.\n\nThe plan we set in motion so long ago cannot be stopped by any mortal agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill forth into your world like a tidal wave of blood and nightmares.\n\nYou and all your kind... are doomed.",
 "A4Q1SuccessfulTyrael": "53Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's tortured spirit to rest. May the Light protect you and the powers of Heaven shine upon your path.\n\nBut, if what you tell me is true, then I fear that we have been played for fools all along.\n\nIzual helped Diablo and his Brothers trick me into using the Soulstones against them... Now the Stones' powers are corrupted.\n\nWith the combined powers of the Soulstones under their control, the Prime Evils will be able to turn the mortal world into a permanent outpost of Hell!",
 "A4Q2AfterInitCain": "54You don't have time to dally about here!\n\nDiablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... Diablo's greatest weapon against you is Terror.\n\nDon't give in to your fears. Resist his power and put an end to him for good!",
 "A4Q2AfterInitTyrael": "48The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself.\n\nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated. He single-handedly destroyed the town of Tristram and corrupted the last noble hero who tried to stop him.\n\nThis time, you must defeat him for good. Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever.\n\nGood luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.",
 "A4Q2ExpansionSuccessCain": "40I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n\nThough my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I've always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom aided you.\n\nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won't have to see them again for many, many years.\n\nPlease talk to Tyrael about leaving this place now!",
 "A4Q2ExpansionSuccessTyrael": "40Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible!\n\nDiablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them, and the corrupted Soulstones are no more.\n\nHowever, while you were fighting here, Baal remained behind in the mortal realm, building an army of hellish minions. Now, Baal's army is searching for the Worldstone, the ancient source of all the Soulstones and their power, while leaving behind a wake of destruction. They have forged deeply into the Barbarian homelands, heading directly for the summit of Mount Arreat!\n\nBaal knows, mortal hero! That is the very site of the blessed Worldstone!\n\nNow, enter the portal I have opened for you. It will take you to the Barbarian city of Harrogath, the last bastion of Order on the slopes of Arreat.",
 "A4Q2InitTyrael": "48The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself.\n\nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated. He single-handedly destroyed the town of Tristram and corrupted the last noble hero who tried to stop him.\n\nThis time, you must defeat him for good. Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever.\n\nGood luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.",

 "A4Q2SuccessfulTyrael": "62Praise be to the Light! You have accomplished the impossible!\n\nDiablo and Mephisto have been banished back into the Black Abyss that spawned them and the corrupted Soulstones are no more.\n\nYou've done well, hero. For now, you should rejoice.",
 "A4Q3InitHasStoneCain": "53The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!\n\nTake the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.\n\nOnly by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
 "A4Q3InitNoStoneCain": "50The time has come to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone! \n\nAlthough I picked it up before entering the Infernal Gate, I believe you should carry out this crucial mission.\n\nTake the Stone to the Hellforge.  Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.\n\nOnly by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
 "A4Q3SuccessfulCain": "70Congratulations, hero!\n\nSurely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the fury unleashed when you smashed his Brother's Soulstone.",
 "A5Q1AfterInitAnya": "84You've proven your skill at rescuing fair maidens... but how are you at killing vicious beasts?",
 "A5Q1AfterInitCain": "83I believe that stopping the siege on Harrogath is the only way for you to earn the trust of these people.",
 "A5Q1AfterInitLarzuk": "150Uh... Did I mention there were catapults?",
 "A5Q1AfterInitMalah": "77Qual-Kehk and his men have been fighting to break the siege for some time. Where many have failed, you may succeed.",
 "A5Q1AfterInitNihlathak": "70After so many have died, who are you to think you can accomplish what our proud warriors could not?",
 "A5Q1AfterInitQualKehk": "66About to face Shenk the Overseer and stop the siege, are you? You should ask Malah to perform your last rites before you go, stranger.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnAnya": "66Those demons have been out there since before your arrival. Can you do nothing to stop them?\n\nYour task is a simple one, warrior. Find Shenk and destroy him.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnCain": "105I understand your reluctance, but now is the time to strike.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnLarzuk": "90What's the matter, hero? Questioning your fortitude? I know we are.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnMalah": "64This may not be very encouraging, but you have fared better than the others who passed through those gates.\n\nIn regards to Shenk the Overseer, remember: a general is nothing without his men.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnNihlathak": "78What are you still doing here? I thought you were going off to die.\n\nGo... Be quick about it.",
 "A5Q1EarlyReturnQualKehk": "93So, you still live. You're either quick or a coward.",
 "A5Q1InitLarzuk": "45If you're here to defeat Baal, you must prove it!\n\nAs we speak, Harrogath is under siege by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death just outside the town walls.\n\nBaal himself travels up the sacred mountain, having left in charge here one of his most vicious generals, Shenk the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, he lashes his own minions into suicidal frenzies on the battlefield.\n\nIf you wish to prove yourself to us, destroy the monster, Shenk, that commands those infernal catapults outside Harrogath.  If you manage to do this, return to me.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulAnya": "108I was starting to wonder how long it would take you to stop those beasts.\n\nGood job.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulCain": "60Those catapults were like nothing I have ever seen before. You have prevailed against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is still far ahead of you.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulLarzuk": "63You're an even greater warrior than I expected... Sorry for underestimating you.\n\nAs a token of my appreciation, I will craft sockets into an item of your choosing, and from now on, you'll get the best price for all my wares.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulMalah": "94Oh... At last, the siege is ended. You truly are an angel.\n\nI thank you.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulNihlathak": "65Ending the siege does not earn immediate respect, outsider.\n\nRespect only comes with sacrifice -- something I'm sure you know nothing of.",
 "A5Q1SuccessfulQualKehk": "68So... You managed to stop the siege.\n\nYou are more powerful than I gave you credit for. You have rightfully earned my respect.",
 "A5Q2AfterInitAnya": "85If those men are being treated like I was, you must find them. They won't survive much longer.",
 "A5Q2AfterInitCain": "74I know firsthand that captivity is a sad fate for a man. Find them quickly.",
 "A5Q2AfterInitLarzuk": "73I crafted the swords and armor for Qual-Kehk's men. They were like brothers to me. I can't imagine the pain they must be suffering.\n\nSave them if you can!",
 "A5Q2AfterInitMalah": "84Qual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned for some time. They are certain to be tired and weak.\n\nYou must protect them once you free them.",
 "A5Q2AfterInitNihlathak": "94You have proven you can take life, warrior, but can you save it as well?",
 "A5Q2AfterInitQualKehk": "85Those of my men fortunate enough to escape on their own told me that they were held captive in the highlands and plateaus.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnAnya": "115Well, you found me on the mountain; I'm sure you'll find them too.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnCain": "63If you are having trouble finding Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to Malah. She healed those who made it back before. Perhaps she would have some advice.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnLarzuk": "76As a kid, I used to play soldier among the barricades on the mountain. There's no easy way through that maze of walls.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnMalah": "67Soldiers who made it back told of a system of barricades placed among the mountain passes. They said that is where the prisoners are held.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnNihlathak": "52Did you ever stop to think why these demons are capturing Qual-Kehk's men? Why they are attacking us? Have you considered what Baal wants with the mountain?\n\nNo. You've not. You have no idea what you are dealing with.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehk": "95They say that discretion, not procrastination, is the better part of valor.",
 "A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehkMan": "78More of my men are still alive out there. I am certain of it!\n\nFind them. Free them from their cages and bring them back to me.",
 "A5Q2InitQualKehk": "58My concerns have turned to my men taken prisoner on the battlefield by Baal's demons. I hate to think what's happened to them.\n\nAs you journey up the mountain, keep your eyes open for my soldiers and bring them back to me if you can.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulAnya": "107I'm sure those men appreciate the freedom you gave them... as much as I do.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulCain": "80You've become a hero to this town, my friend. The shadows have lifted ever since you brought the Light to Harrogath.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulLarzuk": "55Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At first, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm finding them more believable with every passing day.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulMalah": "73You have inspired the people in this town -- not only those you rescued, but those you've helped in other ways as well.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulNihlathak": "72So. You brought the lost sheep home to the shepherd. Well done.",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulQualKehk": "51Thank you for rescuing my men. They have spoken well of your bravery in battle. Perhaps there is hope for us after all. \n\nIf you wish, you may hire some of my mercenaries that you saved. And please... take this set of runes. I had been saving them for a socketed shield, but I think you'll make better use of them.\n\nBe sure to set them in the right order for their fullest effect.",
 "A5Q3AfterInitCain": "59I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak speaks with a venomous tongue and acts as if the entire weight of this town rests upon his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps there is more going on here than we know.",
 "A5Q3AfterInitLarzuk": "57Anya is an amazing alchemist, especially for her young age. As long as I've known her, she's never let anything stop her from pursuing what she believed in. \n\nI wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is involved. Ever since her father died, they haven't gotten along.",
 "A5Q3AfterInitMalah": "94When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. There is no telling what he will say or do.",
 "A5Q3AfterInitNihlathak": "41Anya! Who have you been talking to? Likely it was that meddling Malah. \n\nWell, I'll tell you what really happened. Anya came to me for guidance, after receiving a vision that her mother and younger brother were trapped in the lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had decided to go rescue them. \n\nI told her that her quest was a foolish one and that she would be safer staying within the city walls. However, she is a willful girl and would not listen to me. \n\nThe next morning, she was gone. No one is more distraught than I over losing her. \n\nHowever, if you feel the need to be Malah's errand child, I won't try to stop you.",
 "A5Q3AfterInitQualKehk": "43Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest Elder. He was killed along with the other Elders who erected the ward that protects this city. The ward has kept Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at a costly sacrifice. \n\nNihlathak, on the other hand, was the only Elder to escape the demons. Somehow, he alone managed to find sanctuary, while the others died around him.\n\nEver since that day, Nihlathak and Anya have been at odds.",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnCain": "60Nihlathak's story does sound reasonable, considering what I've heard about Anya. However, the best lies are often hidden within truth.",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnLarzuk": "56As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is the only person, besides Nihlathak, who has any real knowledge of Mount Arreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnMalah": "52If it were anyone else, I would assume her dead. However, Anya is not so easily beaten. I know she must be alive.",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnNihlathak": "46Look, I've told you! She's dead! If you knew what was good for you, you'd concentrate your efforts on saving Harrogath -- not on lost causes like Anya.",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnQualKehk": "81It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak played a part in Anya's disappearance.\n\nWhy would he do such a thing?",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaAnya": "50Hero. Nihlathak did this to me!\n\nIf you've come to help me, my only hope lies with Malah.\n\nPlease... Tell her you've found me...",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaCain": "54Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen Barbarian, Nihlathak... Perhaps Malah can help you where I cannot.",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaLarzuk": "80Poor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak was a traitor...\n\nIf you find him alive, kill him for me!",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaMalah": "56So! That snake Nihlathak was behind Anya's disappearance... and he trapped her with a freezing curse.\n\nHere. Take this potion to Anya and give it to her. That should release her.",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaQualKehk": "70The snake has slipped our grasp! While you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.\n\nI'll bet Anya knows how to track him down.",
 "A5Q3InitMalah": "43There is a matter which I hesitate to share, but I believe you are the only one who can help me now.\n\nAnya, the young alchemist and daughter to one of our slain Elders, has been missing for some time. She is a strong, crafty woman with a spirit like no other.\n\nOne night, just before your arrival, I overheard her and Nihlathak arguing about her father's death. The next morning she was gone.\n\nNihlathak has his own tale as to where she went and why. Don't believe him! I fear he is at the root of her disappearance.\n\nPlease, if you can, search for Anya and bring her back to us. She'll know what to do about Nihlathak.",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulAnya": "80Thank you, hero, for rescuing me.\n\nTo show my personal gratitude, I give you this. I had it custom-made for you by Larzuk.",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulCain": "62For one so young, Anya commands great respect. Now that she is here, I will make it a point to talk to her about Mount Arreat.\n\nYou should do the same.",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulLarzuk": "67I never liked Nihlathak, but I never suspected that he'd betray us! I just can't understand how an Elder could do such a thing.",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulMalah": "48Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. I have devised this spell to increase your resistances as a token of my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I hope you find it helpful.\n\nPlease go talk to Anya. She has urgent news concerning Nihlathak.",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulQualKehk": "140Your rescue of Anya was quite an accomplishment.",
 "A5Q4AfterInitAnya": "90As noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, nothing can excuse his actions.",
 "A5Q4AfterInitCain": "50Regretfully, I know very little about this Relic. However, if what the others say is true, then Baal must not gain possession of it.\n\nStop Nihlathak... before all is lost.",
 "A5Q4AfterInitLarzuk": "56Now, rescuing Anya -- that's good. Talking to me while Nihlathak hands over the Relic to Baal -- uh... that's bad!",
 "A5Q4AfterInitMalah": "65My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak has gone mad.\n\nYou must stop him, before he gives the Relic to the Lord of Destruction!",
 "A5Q4AfterInitQualKehk": "60I saw Nihlathak leave town just before you found Anya. He must be held accountable for his criminal deeds.\n\nFind him and bring him back, if you can. Likely, he won't come willingly, and you'll be forced to kill him.\n\nSo be it.",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnAnya": "55Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the Relic, he shall enter the mountain and wreak havoc there!\n\nI cannot believe that Nihlathak would give the Relic to Baal in any kind of trade. He's truly insane if he believes that he can deal with the Lord of Destruction.",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnCain": "58Ohh... This is a truly horrible turn of events.\n\nI know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way... You have evil on the run.",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnLarzuk": "160...What's there to talk about?\n\nKill Nihlathak!",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnMalah": "63Nihlathak was never the kindest man. But for him to betray the whole world...\n\nAhh... Where shall his soul finally rest?",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnQualKehk": "65My advice is to go in quick and hit hard. Nihlathak can't be half as tough as the beasts you've faced out there.",
 "A5Q4InitAnya": "43Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange for the demon's mercy, the misguided fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the Ancients, our most holy totem!\n\nDoing so will allow Baal to enter Mount Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I tried to stop Nihlathak, but he imprisoned me in that icy tomb.\n\nNihlathak must be stopped before he dooms the whole world. As much as I would love to strangle the life out of him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.\n\nYou must go to his lair through this portal I've opened, kill him, and then bring back the Relic of the Ancients.\n\nStop Nihlathak from destroying what we have striven for eons to protect.",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulAnya": "55You have stopped Nihlathak, but he didn't have the Relic! He must have already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will not be tested when he reaches Arreat's summit.\n\n...Damn Nihlathak!\n\nI do thank you for trying, though. Please, allow me to honor your courage by magically inscribing your name onto an item of your choosing. It's the least I can do.",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulCain": "90Beware! Baal grows stronger with every passing moment.",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulLarzuk": "93Hmmm... What does Baal plan to do inside Mount Arreat?",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulMalah": "65So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on failures past. It is your future that matters more.",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulQualKehk": "57Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall find his home among the tortured minions of Hell!\n\nYou battled the Darkness without fear. I laud your skill and courage.",
 "A5Q5AfterInitAnya": "72You wouldn't have to test yourself against the Ancients if it weren't for Nihlathak's treachery. He was a fool and deserves to suffer for eternity.",
 "A5Q5AfterInitCain": "90A test of mettle is a fitting rite of passage for a Barbarian hero.",
 "A5Q5AfterInitLarzuk": "75Every night, I've prayed to the Ancients to bring us peace... and now you must fight them.\n\nHuh... Who shall I pray to now, warrior?",
 "A5Q5AfterInitMalah": "65By reaching the summit, you cease being just a simple warrior. When you come back, you will be far more.",
 "A5Q5AfterInitQualKehk": "63The Ancients are not our enemies. Remember that! They are our ancestors -- our gods.",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnAnya": "71Look. I must apologize.\n\nI feel responsible for your current struggle. If I had only stopped Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, you would not have to fight those ghosts.",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnCain": "52We have come too far to be defeated now, my friend. I have seen you complete many difficult quests. Though this may be your greatest trial, it is not beyond your reach.",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnLarzuk": "70You've walked on the burial grounds of our greatest ancestors. I'm not sure whether I should bow before you or revile you for committing sacrilege.\n\nTread lightly when you walk with gods.",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnMalah": "68Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are worthy to pass through the Ancients' gates, but you must believe, as well.",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnQualKehk": "114I warned you!\n\nThe Ancients are not like the demons you're accustomed to fighting.",
 "A5Q5InitQualKehk": "37Every time I hear of you, warrior, your deeds become more legendary.\n\nBut take heed. You are approaching the very summit of Mount Arreat. I have never dared venture there. It is sacred -- our most holy place. The legends say it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who block the path of all who are unworthy.\n\nYour reputation here does not matter... It will be the Ancients who determine your worthiness.\n\nGood luck.",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulAnya": "82You stand before me a worthy hero -- and on you rests the last hope of our people.\n\nBear it well, warrior.",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulCain": "67You have proven yourself to these people. They look to you as their warrior, their champion.",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulLarzuk": "82The Ancients have honored you, and in turn, so do we. I have no remaining doubts about you, now.",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulMalah": "60I knew the Ancients would find you worthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, stop Baal before he destroys all that is sacred.",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulQualKehk": "75Besting the Ancients in battle is a mighty feat indeed. I hope this means you're ready to battle Baal.",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnAnya": "60Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering the Worldstone Chamber? This truly has become a battle against Hell.\n\nWhether or not it was the Heavens' decree, this is your fight now -- your destiny.",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnCain": "51Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful of the ancient Horadrim.\n\nYour battles with Mephisto and Diablo will pale in comparison to your battle with Baal.\n\nThe Lord of Destruction aided by Tal Rasha's knowledge... The mountain itself will tremble when you clash.",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnLarzuk": "59I may be just an armorer, but I know this... Baal plans to destroy the world with the secrets contained in that mountain. It doesn't take a genius to know he has to be stopped.",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnMalah": "70You knew it would eventually come down to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnQualKehk": "63You have ventured to a place beyond legend. You rush to face an evil few can even imagine.\n\nBe careful, my friend, and may the Light watch over you.",
 "A5Q6InitAncients": "31You are a worthy hero! We augment your skill and grant you entry to the interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies the Worldstone.\n\nBeware. You will not be alone. Baal the Lord of Destruction is already inside. \n\nThe Archangel Tyrael has always been our benefactor, but even he cannot help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's spiritual presence from entering the chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, mortal, have the power to defeat Baal now.\n\nBaal threatens the Worldstone -- and through it, the mortal realm, itself. You must stop him before he gains full control of the sacred stone. With it under his control, Baal could shatter the boundaries between this world and the Burning Hells, thus allowing the hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth into the mortal realm like an unstoppable tide!\n\nIf you are weak, the world as you know it could be lost forever. You must NOT fail!",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulAnya": "53You have done the impossible, hero. Your defeat of the last of the three Prime Evils is a great victory for the Light. \n\nStrange that you say that the Worldstone must be destroyed. The prophecies said nothing about that.\n\nPerhaps all we have fought for will be lost... or perhaps we'll never need fight again!",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulCain": "40I knew in time you would defeat Baal. You have done everything you set out to do, my friend.\n\nEver since you rescued me from Tristram, I have believed in you. It has been a supreme honor to aid you along the way. \n\nSo... The Worldstone was corrupted by Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. Worry not. Through whatever lies ahead I have faith that the Light will guide us both.\n\nGo, now, back to the Worldstone chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael has opened for you.",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulLarzuk": "74The Ancients themselves will envy our songs about you.\n\nPlease, don't forget about us! Farewell, my friend.",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulMalah": "48If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be destroyed, then it must. We cannot let Baal's corruption prevail!\n\nThe world will change, true -- but who is to say it isn't for the better?",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulQualKehk": "60The destruction of the Worldstone does not bode well for our world. But I'll try not to worry...\n\nAfter all, we have warriors like you fighting for us and for the Light.\n\nFarewell!",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulTyrael": "40I am impressed, mortal. You have overcome the greatest challenge this world has ever faced and defeated the last of the Prime Evils. However, we are too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's destructive touch has corrupted it completely.\n\nGiven enough time, the Worldstone's energies will drain away and the barriers between the worlds will shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood into this... Sanctuary... and eradicate your people and everything you've labored to build.\n\nTherefore, I must destroy the corrupted Worldstone before the powers of Hell take root. This act will change your world forever -- with consequences even I cannot foresee. However, it is the only way to ensure mankind's survival.\n\nGo now, mortal. I have opened a portal that will lead you to safety.\n\nMay the Eternal Light shine upon you and your descendants for what you've done this day. The continued survival of mankind is your legacy! Above all else, you have earned a rest from this endless battle.",

 "CainAct2Gossip3": "70Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him all the same.",

She appears to be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a secret order that has been around for centuries... almost as long as the Horadrim, itself.\n\nHer presence here makes me uneasy, for they are traditionally sworn to hunt down Magi who have betrayed the trust of their order.\n\nI wonder why she is here.",

 "CainAct3IntroGossip1": "45I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for many years. But I never would have imagined it could be so corrupted.\n\nCertainly, this must be Mephisto's work! You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo and Baal are still out there and you must find them.",
 "CainAct4Gossip1": "48I have read much about the enigmatic Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in Horadrim lore both for his compassion for mortals and his unquenchable spirit.\n\nIt was rumored that he went against the wishes of Heaven and gave the Horadrim the original Soulstones in order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.",
 "CainAct4IntroGossip1": "41Can you believe this place? Did you ever dare to dream that you'd one day stand upon the crossroads between Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium Fortress is truly miraculous.\n\nHowever, your journey is not yet over. Diablo still roams free in Hell, marshalling his demonic forces. Only when he is beaten will our world finally have peace.\n\nHurry now... the sands of time slow for no one! ",
 "CainAct5Gossip1": "52With hellspawn, size is no measure of their threat. Demons half the size of men can kill with a gesture, while hellish pack animals trample any who stand in their way.",
 "CainAct5Gossip10": "54It is my belief that the Soulstones are at the center of this conflict. If only that fool Marius had not intervened, Baal would still be imprisoned within Tal Rasha.",
 "CainAct5Gossip2": "55Though these Barbarians are known throughout the kingdoms as ferocious fighters, they are also capable of great compassion.\n\nThey have trained throughout history for a battle their legends foretell will decide the fate of the world.",
 "CainAct5Gossip3": "55The angel Tyrael has watched over the guardians of Arreat throughout history. I do not believe that Baal and Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry few souls.\n\nThey are here to settle a conflict as old as time itself.",
 "CainAct5Gossip4": "44During my time with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat.\n\nWe knew that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred duty. However, many dismissed their zeal as simple superstition... combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders.\n\nThose Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again... Still, I do not believe they died at the hands of Barbarians.",
 "CainAct5Gossip5": "41All users of the magical arts know of Mount Arreat, but few understand its true nature. It is the nexus of an unfathomable magic.\n\nIt bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction races to its summit with such purpose. I fear for the whole world should Baal gain what he seeks.",
 "CainAct5Gossip6": "59I have spent decades trying to understand the forces at work in this world. But in the face of all that is transpiring, I realize how meager my knowledge is.\n\nI will be of assistance where I can, my friend.",
 "CainAct5Gossip7": "54Though the Elder Council of Harrogath is gone, there are many capable young leaders to take their place.\n\nAnya certainly has enough courage and intelligence to lead them all, if they can survive this catastrophe.",
 "CainAct5Gossip8": "53Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of feminine strength...\n\nShe reminds me of the Zakarum priestesses I knew in my youth. They don't take vows of chastity, you know.",
 "CainAct5Gossip9": "65It is fortunate that this town has such a talented smith.\n\nThe quality of Larzuk's work surely complements your skills. In fact, he would have been quite welcome amongst the Horadrim.",
 "CainAct5IntroGossip1": "39I am amazed to find this place so untouched. Everything else in the path of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in ruin. \n\nThese Barbarians must indeed be the legendary guardians of Mount Arreat. They are a proud, hardy people. Don't expect to be greeted warmly -- strangers here rarely are.\n\nPerhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend some time with the townsfolk and try to understand them better. I'll let you know what I discover.",
 "CainGossip1": "43Long ago, the Soulstones were given to the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. They were used to bind the three Prime Evils. I now know that even these holy artifacts were no match for Diablo's power.\n\nI hope that his two brothers are more securely held... but I fear the worst.",
 "CainGossip2": "54It takes time to master your skills... and use will hone your technique. But take care to choose your new skills wisely.",
 "CainGossip3": "52You may recover some mysterious things from the demons you kill. Some of great use to you... some of great peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal their secrets.",
 "CainGossip4": "46Have I told you about the Horadrim? They were an ancient confederation of mage-clans who sought to bind the three Prime Evils for eternity. The Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... and it appears that the bonds they wove are unravelling!\n\nAs the last of the Horadrim, I pray that I can help you remedy their failure.",
 "CainGossip5": "43Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It seems that Hell's balance has shifted, as Andariel is now aligned with the Lord of Terror. Her presence here in the mortal realm does not bode well for us.",

It's good to see some strong adventurers around here.\n\nMany of our Sisters fought bravely against Diablo when he first attacked the town of Tristram.

Well, I can tell you that it's got nothing to do with the local town guards... they're all in the palace for some reason.\n\nJerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to help keep the peace around here. We're not cheap, but we're the best this wasteland has to offer.",

 "JerhynActIntroGossip1": "41Greetings, honored traveler. I am Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm glad to know that once again caravans are free to travel through the Western Pass.\n\nFor some time now, we have been under siege by an evil power that I cannot identify. Strange... It all began when a Dark Wanderer came this way, looking for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain to be far out in the desert.\n\nNow, my people whisper tales of the dead rising from their tombs and horrible creatures lurking amongst the moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed things which I cannot explain. I've ordered the port closed and all trade ships moored until I am sure that my city is safe.\n\nAtma, the tavernkeeper, has an important mission for you. Go see her immediately. You'll find her on the other side of town.\n\nNow, I must return to the palace. I apologize, but I can't invite you in. Things are... rather a mess right now.",
 "JerhynActIntroMoreGossip1": "51For trade in magic and the like, see Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the wisest man I know - without equal in magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion chemist.\n\nFor travel back west, see Warriv, whom you already know.\n\nOur own Fara is a fine and honest armorer, and she can heal wounds as well.\n\nElzix is the Innkeeper and may also have some items to trade.\n\nGreiz, the mercenary captain I hired to secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps order in town, as well.\n\nThere are others here, too. I'm sure you'll meet most of them. Just look around...",
 "JerhynGossip1": "117Things are getting worse by the hour. I know everything looks fine, but trust me, it isn't!",
 "JerhynGossip2": "63To any who aid me in the defense of Lut Gholein, I pledge my support. Passage East, wealth, honor - all are due to those who help my city.",
 "JerhynGossip3": "71You seem very capable, but no offense is intended when I say that I must choose my confidants carefully. It wouldn't do to have rumors sending everyone into a panic.",
 "JerhynGossip4": "87Even though he was once a bandit, I permitted Elzix to take over the Desert Rain Inn. He has been quite civilized ever since.",
 "JerhynGossip5": "76When you arrived, Warriv's caravan had been long overdue. With all of the evil that's arisen in the land, I'm surprised he got through at all.",
 "JerhynGossip6": "77Meshif is an honorable man, but I fear that he is growing impatient with me about impounding his ship. I dare not tell him what's really happening in this city.",
 "JerhynGossip7": "98The woman, Atma, may have some useful gossip for you. She can always be found near her public house.",

 "KashyaIntroAmaGossip1": "55Well, well, I never expected to see an Amazon in these lands. You're very brave to have come here. Many of my fellow Sisters have fallen under some dark spell, and if you're not careful you may fall prey to it as well.",
 "KashyaIntroGossip1": "56Welcome, outlander, to our glorious hovel. I know you're here to challenge the evil that's driven us from our ancestral home.\n\nBut, know this. Akara may be our spiritual leader, but I command the Rogues in battle. It will take more than just killing a few beasts in the wilderness to earn my trust.",

Our homeland is hardly recognizable with so much evil about.\n\nYet, I've managed to survive so far. You've seen your share of suffering as well, I'm sure. Seeing you again -- alive -- does my heart good. I shall pray that you can help us out of this hell.\n\nBaal has laid waste to our mountain and its denizens. His minions continue to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk and his men have proven helpless to stop them. Baal is still out on the mountain looking for something -- but I know not what.\n\nNihlathak is the last survivor of the Council of Elders, but I'm afraid he has not been himself lately. The other Elders sacrificed themselves to place a protective ward around Harrogath. If Nihlathak is curt with you, it is because he feels responsible for our situation. He does not relish sending more of our people out to die.\n\nSo much has changed since you left that I see little hope for us in this life.\n\nIf you need healing or a potion, please come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite his disposition, may be of some assistance with other wares. Finally, Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads Harrogath's remaining forces against Baal.",

Baal is still out on the mountain looking for something -- but I know not what. \n\nAll of the Elders, save Nihlathak, sacrificed themselves to place a protective ward around Harrogath.\n\nSome of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do not appreciate your presence. We are a proud people, and it is not easy for us to accept aid. I, however, am glad you are here.\n\nIf you need healing or a potion, please come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, armor, and repairs.

However, my powers never developed beyond the simplest of spells. Although I can heal almost any wound with time and energy, there is little I can do to help against Baal.\n\nBut enough of that...I spend too much time in reflection and have forgotten my manners.\n\nI, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, the last stronghold of Order on Mount Arreat.

 "MalahGossip13": "44With the exception of Qual-Kehk, the townspeople do not see what I see -- the massacre we face.\n\nOur bravest, strongest heroes hobble back to me begging for help. I do what I can -- healing and bandaging some, preparing the others for what lies beyond.",
 "MalahGossip2": "42I know you and my son, Bannuk, did not part on the best of terms. He did not understand the wanderlust that drove you to leave your homeland. However, even though Bannuk could never admit it to me, as he grew older I could see that same desire in his eyes.\n\nOh... It's a pity I didn't encourage him to go with you. He might still be alive today.",

 "MalahGossip6": "53Perhaps you have heard the accounts of my son's horrible death at the hands of Baal's minions. He was my last living child...\n\nThe oath of compassion I have taken as a healer extends only to humankind.\n\nCut them down, warrior. All of them!",
 "MalahGossip7": "78The catapults are infernal machines made of demon flesh fused with steel.\n\nBe wary of them.",
 "MalahGossip8": "60Qual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the losses have borne heavily upon him. He is only impatient because he judges the worth of a warrior by action, not words.\n\nYou must prove yourself worthy of his trust.",
 "MalahGossip9": "52Larzuk possesses a good soul, but at times his mind seems quite unsound. \n\nHe once asked me for twenty of my finest sheepskins. He said he would fill them with hot air and float like a cloud above the battlefield to spy on Baal's legions! \n\nI worry the siege has driven him mad.",

 "NihlathakAct5IntroGossip1": "43Well, well. The siege has everything in short supply... except fools. \n\nWhy would you seek this place, stranger? Are you a vulture come to loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? \n\nRegardless, this is no place to make a name for yourself. The mountain is ours to protect. It is only a matter of time before Hell's legions are routed.",
 "NihlathakAct5IntroNecGossip1": "45Ahhh, a Necromancer.\n\nWhile I admire your courage in seeking out the darker side of magic, we really have little need of your skills. The battle will turn soon enough without your meddling. \n\nYet, I should have expected to see your kind here. You are like a moth to the flame -- drawn to all this death. It feeds you in more ways than one, does it not?",
 "NihlathakGossip1": "49If you're looking for cases of treacherous magic, Assassin, take a hard look at Larzuk. He was the only one in town who escaped the Red Fever last spring. He claimed his good fortune was due to 'hand washing' before meals.\n\nHmmm... Very suspicious...",

 "NihlathakGossip5": "37Oh yes... I remember our warriors as children. Malah would set their broken bones and give them powders for their fevers. Now, they return to her with wounds that will never heal.\n\nI am tired... Please... leave me.",

So, if you trust us enough to enter our gates, I trust you enough to let you stay.\n\nI am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms of Harrogath.\n\nYou have the look of a warrior... An extra soldier will be useful. But don't expect anyone to mourn if you get yourself killed. \n\nBaal is true to his namesake. He has ravaged through our lands like a merciless plague.\n\nThe protective ward laid down by our lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay, but Baal's siege has taken its toll all the same.\n\nMost of my men are now dead.

There they hope to find their eldest brother, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was imprisoned there ages ago.\n\nIf the three Prime Evils unite, they will be invincible. Though it is unclear as to what their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all costs.\n\nI am broken and the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing rapidly.\n\nYou must take up this quest and prevent the Three Brothers from reuniting. You must cross the sea and search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.\n\nNow hurry, mortal... Time is running out for all of us!",

 "WarrivAct1IntroGossip1": "45Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have traveled this way since the recent troubles began.\n\nNo doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again.\n\nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark Wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago. He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the Rogue Monastery.\n\nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake. You see, shortly after the Wanderer went through, the Monastery's Gates to the pass were closed and strange creatures began ravaging the countryside.\n\nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the gates are re-opened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all.  If you're still alive then, I'll take you along.\n\nYou should talk to Akara, too. She seems to be the leader of this camp. Maybe she can tell you more.",
 "WarrivAct1IntroPalGossip1": "45Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a while since I've seen any of your kind in the west. It would be an honor to aid you in any way that I can.\n\nNo doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again.\n\nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark Wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago.

 "WarrivAct2Gossip1": "106Caravans take people where they want to go - until they get there.",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip2": "80By ship is the only way eastward from here. I believe Captain Meshif has a small trading vessel moored at the docks.",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip3": "70There used to be a lot of brothels here... I guess the troubles scared all the women away, or maybe they're 'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip4": "53That old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty as they come. Years back, he made off with a small fortune of my caravan's wares. I certainly never expected to see him so... domesticated.",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip5": "57Jerhyn has his father's strength and wits. He's young, but he rules this place with wisdom and care. I think he'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided we all survive this crisis.",
 "WarrivAct2IntroGossip1": "62Now that Andariel is dead, I can return and outfit the Rogues properly. Once I've made some trades here, I'll be free to head back to their Monastery. Let me know if you want to travel along.",
 "WarrivGossip1": "51I've been leading my trade caravan across the eastern deserts for more than twenty years now. I've been attacked by bandits and outlaws more times than I can remember. But never when a Paladin accompanied me. \n\nIndeed, your Order has saved me from losing a small fortune over the years. I just hope you can discover what's going on around here and get the Gates to the East opened up!",
 "WarrivGossip2": "85Cain seems to have great wisdom regarding the supernatural. I hope I never live to be that wise...",
 "WarrivGossip3": "58Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She sells the few magic items in her possession and can even heal your wounds. She is very wise and will help you if she can.",
 "WarrivGossip4": "66The fiery Kashya commands the Rogue archers in battle. I've only spoken to her a few times, though. I get the feeling that she doesn't like outsiders very much.",
 "WarrivGossip5": "88Charsi seems to be a very sweet girl. She's the smith around here and can help you by trading weapons and armor.",
 "WarrivGossip6": "55Gheed is a wandering merchant of questionable character who is traveling along with my caravan to the East. He will buy and sell most anything.\n\nHe's greedy, but his wares are beyond reproach. I would suggest keeping both eyes open when you deal with him.",
 "WarrivGossip7": "71To the east are lands of great mystery... and the Jewel City of the Desert, Lut Gholein.",
 "WarrivGossip8": "68I'll gladly take you eastward, if you can drive the Evil from the Monastery.  Then, the Rogues may re-open the pass through the mountains.",
 "WarrivGossip9": "70It's easy to become lost in the wilderness on the way to the Citadel. After you have come to the Cairn Stones, you must remember that the path continues through the caves.",
