 "A1Q1AfterInitAkara": "46\nI should add that many Rogue scouts \nhave died in that horrible place. We \ncannot afford to lose any more. If you \nchoose to enter that Den of Evil, you \nmust do so alone.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt": "95\nYou seem like a noble warrior. I hope \nyou can help us.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain": "95\nThe beasts from the cave have begun to \nroam throughout the countryside. \nYou'd better be careful out there.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitGheed": "67\nYou're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust \nmy sacred scepter into the foulest, \ncarbuncular trull than set one boot \ninto that cave.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitKashya": "87\nThe demons in that cave have claimed \nmany of my finest archers. I wonder \nhow you will fare!\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitWarriv": "122\nOne who seeks that cave, seeks death.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara": "85\nYour task is not complete until you have \nkilled all the demons in that cave.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi": "148\nYou haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do \nyou need anything?\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed": "73\nDemons still befouling that cave, huh? I \nthink you might need a new weapon.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya": "111\nYou'd better come through on this. Your \nreputation depends on it.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv": "124\nOne who hesitates... does so with good \nreason.\n",
 "A1Q1InitAkara": "43\nThere is a place of great evil in the \nwilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts \nhave informed me that a cave nearby is \nfilled with shadowy creatures and \nhorrors from beyond the grave.\n \nI fear that these creatures are massing \nfor an attack against our encampment. \nIf you are sincere about helping us, \nfind the dark labyrinth and destroy the \nfoul beasts.\n \nMay the Great Eye watch over you.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulAkara": "65\nYou have cleansed the Den of Evil. \nYou've earned my trust and may yet \nrestore my faith in humanity.\n \nYour reward is training in the skill of \nyour choice.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi": "94\nYou are truly brave and skillful...  Akara \nwas worried about you.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulGheed": "87\nThe only good demon is a dead one, I \nsay.\n \nBy the way, did you happen to find \nanything in that cave you'd like to sell?\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulKashya": "74\nHmm. I'm surprised you survived that \ntest, outlander. Go see Akara. She may \nreward you.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv": "120\n...That which does not kill you makes \nyou stronger.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitAkara": "51\nBlood Raven fought valiantly against \nDiablo in the catacombs beneath \nTristram... She was never quite the \nsame afterwards. It is now obvious she \nbrought an evil influence back with her.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitCharsi": "99\nBlood Raven was the leader of a Rogue \nband that once fought Diablo at \nTristram.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitGheed": "94\nI'm sorry... The undead are bad for \ntrade. I have a strict no-return policy.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitKashya": "80\nDeath has done nothing to weaken \nBlood Raven's combat skills. If \nanything, she's more deadly than ever.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitWarriv": "140\nHmmm...\n \nHow can one kill what is already dead?\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara": "70\nIf you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear \nthat our Order will perish forever.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi": "68\nAkara felt something was wrong even \nbefore Andariel descended upon us. \nShe feared that Blood Raven had \nstumbled upon some evil force beneath \nTristram.\n \nI wish we had acted then...\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed": "77\nI wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is \namong the undead? Oh, she had dirt on \neverybody.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya": "99\nEach moment you delay adds another \nundead Sister to Blood Raven's army.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv": "86\nWhen the dead return to prey upon the \nliving, it is a terror beyond \nunderstanding.\n",
 "A1Q2InitKashya": "56\nMy Rogue scouts have just reported an \nabomination in the Monastery \ngraveyard!\n \nApparently, Andariel is not content to \ntake only our living. Blood Raven, one \nof our finest captains in the battle \nagainst Diablo at Tristram, was also \none of the first to be corrupted by \nAndariel.\n \nNow, you'll find her in the Monastery \ngraveyard raising our dead as \nzombies!\n \nWe cannot abide this defilement! If you \nare truly our ally, you will help us \ndestroy her.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulAkara": "122\nAndariel must be made to pay for her \nsacrilege!\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi": "77\nKashya wishes to reward you for your \ndefeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, \ntoo, even though Blood Raven was once \nmy friend.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulGheed": "148\nSome of those gals weren't so nice the \nfirst time around.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulKashya": "55\nI can hardly believe that you've defeated \nBlood Raven!\n \nThough she was once my closest friend, \nI pray that her tortured spirit remains \nbanished forever.\n \nYou have earned my respect, stranger... \nand the allegiance of the Rogues. I \nhave placed several of my best \nwarriors at your disposal.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv": "104\nYou've done well, stranger. I hope all \nyour efforts are worth it.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitAkara": "59\nThe retrieval of the Horadric Malus is \nnot without risk. Our Monastery is \nfilled with voracious hellspawn. You'd \nbest be careful, my friend.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCain": "51\nThe Malus was forged and enchanted by \nthe ancient Horadric Mages during the \nSin Wars. When their union dissolved, \nthe Malus was entrusted to the \nSisterhood guarding the pass into the \nEast.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCharsi": "87\nThe Monastery can confuse even those \nwho know it well. Stay alert in there.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheed": "74\nCharsi talks of nothing anymore, but \nthis Horadric Malus. Between you and \nher my ears need a rest.\n \nJust find it and bring it back quickly.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt": "74\nI have offered my nomadic phallus, but \nto no avail.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitKashya": "61\nCharsi is wasting her time and talents \nusing an inferior hammer! Had she the \nHoradric Malus, she could make the \nsteel sing and craft you a suit of armor \nas impenetrable as the Great Eye.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitWarriv": "68\nJust as an archer needs bow and arrow, \nor a draughtsman pen and paper, so \nCharsi needs the Horadric Malus with \nwhich to ply her trade.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara": "98\nIf you can't carry out this quest, how \nwill you face the greater evils ahead?\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57\nThe Malus has eluded you so far. Well, \nsearch thoroughly in the Barracks... \nThat is where the Rogues kept their \nforge.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi": "89\nThe Malus is a Horadric artifact of \ngreat power. Please bring it back.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed": "90\nI have heard that you bear us no Malus.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya": "71\nTo do battle with Andariel requires \nmore than thick skin and a strong will. \nYou'll want armor and weaponry forged \nwith the hammer's enchantments.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv": "120\nWhat better opportunity to show your \nmettle?\n",
 "A1Q3InitCharsi": "66\nWhen I fled the Monastery, I left behind \nthe Horadric Malus, my enchanted \nsmithing hammer. If you can retrieve it \nfor me, I'll use its magic to strengthen \nyour equipment.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulAkara": "57\nWell done, my friend. But remember, the \nreturn of the Horadric Malus is but one \nstep in reclaiming the Monastery.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCain": "59\nThe magical effects imbued by the \nMalus are impossible to predict, but \nare always to the good.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi": "72\nOh! Thanks so much for returning the \nHoradric Malus! I will now imbue one of \nyour items with magical powers.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulGheed": "120\nI guess it's too late to take back some \nof the names I called you.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulKashya": "74\nNow that the Horadric Malus is back in \nour possession, we shall use it to \ndeliver a great blow against the Evil \nwhich torments this land.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv": "118\nI am glad the hammer has returned and \nyou with it.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara": "42\nTristram is too far to journey by foot...  \nCain would likely be dead, when you \narrived. However, there is a magical \nportal that will take you there \ninstantly.\n \nTo open it, one must stand within the \ncircle of Cairn Stones and touch them \nin a certain order. The proper order \ncan be found in the runes written on \nthe bark of the Tree of Inifuss.\n \nYou must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss \nand bring back its bark. I will translate \nthe runes to unlock the Stones' mystic \npattern.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi": "117\nIf you bring back the bark of Inifuss, \nAkara will tell you how to get to \nTristram.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollGheed": "98\nI would sooner micturate in a tankard \nof my own ale than journey to \nTristram!\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollKashya": "90\nThe bark of Inifuss holds mystical \nrunes.\n \nAkara can translate them... into our \nrevenge!\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollWarriv": "68\nMonths ago, I came across a few \nsurvivors from Tristram. They said \nthat Cain had gone half-mad and could \nno longer distinguish fact from \nfantasy.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnAkara": "64\nIf he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in \ngrave peril! You must hurry to Tristram \nbefore all is lost!\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnCharsi": "92\nI have heard that Tristram is now in \nruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin \nof all of us.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnGheed": "68\nI'm told that Tristram now resembles a \nmead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! \nI will wait here for your most glorious \nreturn.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnKashya": "103\nDeckard Cain has crucial knowledge \nabout the Evils we face. You must find \nhim!\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSAkara": "76\nHow will you find Cain without going to \nTristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is \nthe first step on your journey.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSGheed": "99\nBarking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll \nfind it, just keep looking.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSKashya": "96\nThe Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but \nyou'll know it when you see it.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSWarriv": "70\nHe who seeks that which cannot be \nfound must look inside himself for \nfurther guidance... or look harder!\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnWarriv": "82\nIt is too dangerous to travel to \nTristram. I won't be leaving here until \nthe way is clear!\n",
 "A1Q4InitAkara": "50\nIt is clear that we are facing an Evil \ndifficult to comprehend, let alone \ncombat.\n \nThere is only one Horadrim sage, \nschooled in the most arcane history \nand lore, who could advise us... His \nname is Deckard Cain.\n \nYou must go to Tristram and find him, \nmy friend. I pray that he still lives.\n",
 "A1Q4InstructionsAkara": "64\nAh, very good. I have translated the \nrunes on this scroll. You must find the \nCairn Stones and touch them in the \norder that I have written.\n",
 "A1Q4InstructionsCharsi": "150\nWithout the bark of Inifuss you can't \nfind Cain.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulAkara": "82\nYou have risked your life to rescue \nCain. For that we thank you.\n \nWe must seek his counsel immediately.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCain": "74\nAs a token of my gratitude, I will \nidentify items for you at no charge.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCharsi": "102\nAkara wishes to reward you for your \nbravery in returning Deckard Cain.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulGheed": "53\nAh, Cain is here... another customer. I \nhaven't been this pleased since a \nlove-starved maiden let down a bit \nmore than her hair.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulKashya": "78\nAgain, you amaze me, outlander.\n \nThe Sisterhood is grateful to you for \ndelivering Cain to us. I believe Akara \nhas something to tell you.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulWarriv": "80\nOnly a brave adventurer could return \nwith Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward \nfor your valor.\n",
 "A1Q4RescuedByHeroCain": "82\n...I thank you, friend, for coming to my \naid.\n",
 "A1Q4RescuedByRoguesCain": "75\nOh... Blessings on the Rogues! They \nfinally rescued me from that cursed \nplace!\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollCharsi": "168\nGet this to Akara.\n \nOnly she can understand it.\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollGheed": "72\nLook, friend... I trade a lot of strange \nitems, but I'm not going to start \ndealing in bark. Okay?\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollKashya": "82\nWith this scroll you may open a portal \nback to Tristram. Only Akara can \ndecipher its logic.\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollWarriv": "86\nThis looks like gibberish to me. Akara \nmay know what to make of it.\n",
 "A1Q4TragedyOfTristramCain": "33\nRegrettably, I could do nothing to \nprevent the disaster which devastated \nTristram. It would appear that our \ngreatest fears have come to pass. \nDiablo, the Lord of Terror, has once \nagain been set loose upon the world!\n \nAs you know, some time ago Diablo was \nslain beneath Tristram.  And when our \nhero emerged triumphant from the \nlabyrinth beneath town, we held a \ngrand celebration that lasted several \ndays.\n \nYet, as the weeks passed, our hero \nbecame increasingly aloof. He kept his \ndistance from the rest of the townsfolk \nand seemed to lapse into a dark, \nbrooding depression. I thought that \nperhaps his ordeal had been so \ndisturbing that he simply could not put \nit out of his mind.\n \nThe hero seemed more tormented every \npassing day. I remember he awoke \nmany times -- screaming in the night -- \nalways something about 'the East'.\n \nOne day, he simply left. And shortly \nthereafter Tristram was attacked by \nlegions of foul demons. Many were \nslain, and the demons left me to die in \nthat cursed cage.\n \nI believe now that Tristram's hero was \nthat Dark Wanderer who passed this \nway before the Monastery fell.\n \nI fear even worse, my friend... I fear \nthat Diablo has taken possession of the \nhero who sought to slay him. If true, \nDiablo will become more powerful than \never before.\n \nYou must stop him or all will be lost.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitAkara": "67\nThe dangers there are not solely \narchitectural. Once inside that \nwretched place, many succumb to a \nvile miasma.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCain": "60\nThat tower marks a place of danger. \nThere is an epic poem about it...  How \nmuch sorrow one can stand was tested \nthere.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCharsi": "70\nThat old tower is as rotten on the inside \nas it appears on the outside. I heard \nthat several Sisters came to a \ngruesome end when a stairwell \ncollapsed on them.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitGheed": "110\nThe only wealth you're likely to find \nthere is a wealth of vermin.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitKashya": "78\nThe tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we \nhave found are death, delirium, and \ndisappointment.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitWarriv": "81\nRumors of treasure are no different \nfrom rumors of any other kind. They \nhold false promise to those who should \nknow better.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnAkara": "140\nThere is no more I can tell you about \nthat ancient tower.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCain": "94\nQuickly in and quickly out is all the \nadvice I can give you.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCharsi": "170\nYou're not ready to give up, are you?\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnGheed": "79\nGuess what! I've named a boil on my \nass after you. It, too, bothers me every \ntime I sit down.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnKashya": "151\nHave you suddenly lost your taste for \nwealth?\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnWarriv": "118\nBetter an empty pocket than a full \ngrave.\n",
 "A1Q5InitQuestTome": "36\n...And so it came to pass that the \nCountess, who once bathed in the \nrejuvenating blood of a hundred \nvirgins, was buried alive... And her \ncastle in which so many cruel deeds \ntook place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising \nover the buried dungeons in that \ngod-forsaken wilderness, a solitary \ntower, like some monument to Evil, is \nall that remains.\n \nThe Countess' fortune was believed to \nbe divided among the clergy, although \nsome say that more remains unfound, \nstill buried alongside the rotting skulls \nthat bear mute witness to the \ninhumanity of the human creature.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulAkara": "58\nI thought the stories of treasure in the \ntower were nothing but lies. I am glad \nyou found something of value in that \ndeath-trap. Would that our Sisters had \nbeen so fortunate.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCain": "69\nWell done, my friend. Courage and \nopportunity together have created in \nyou a kind of alchemy.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCharsi": "126\nThose riches will serve you well on the \nlong road ahead.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulGheed": "68\nWarriv's advice is like corpse gas; it \nbefouls the air for a moment and then \nit disappears.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulKashya": "79\nYour rewards are well-earned. To us, \nthe tower was nothing more than a \nheadstone looming over a long \nforgotten grave.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulWarriv": "62\nRemember. Wealth is as insubstantial \nas a cloud and passes as quickly. \nIgnore Gheed. All that twitters is not \nbold.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitAkara": "63\nAndariel has desecrated all we hold \ndear. She must not be permitted to \nserve Diablo.\n \nDestroy her! Her corruption of our \nOrder must be undone!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCain": "45\nDiablo is heading east for some foul \npurpose. And the only passage east is \nthrough the Monastery gate. \nObviously, Diablo summoned Andariel \nto block any pursuit.\n \nFor her part Andariel hopes to win \nDiablo's favor... the lesser demons are \nalways vying for positions of power \nwithin the unholy hierarchy!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCharsi": "132\nSend Andariel back to the Hell she came \nfrom!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitGheed": "71\nYou're going after Andariel?\n \n... One of my wagon wheels is in need of \nrepair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm \nneeded.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitKashya": "81\nI can imagine a thousand different ways \nto kill Andariel. You need only choose \none.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitWarriv": "72\nThe mapmakers tell us the shortest \ndistance between two points is a \nstraight line.\n \nOur way east is a line that runs through \nAndariel's stronghold, the Monastery.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturn2Kashya": "126\nDeckard Cain has important information \nabout Andariel.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnAkara": "57\nYou have done much to help us, but I \nsense that this has only fueled \nAndariel's fury. She will not stop until \nwe are all dead.\n \nYou must kill Andariel before her army \ncan gain the upper hand.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCain": "48\nIt is clear that Andariel is acting on \nbehalf of Diablo to prevent anyone \nfrom following him eastward. Her \ndefeat would allow you to continue the \npursuit.\n \nAncient lore has it that while Andariel \nwas spawned in the Burning Hells, she \nis not fond of fire.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCharsi": "108\nIf you are the hero that you seem to be, \nnow is the time to prove it.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnGheed": "72\nHave you stumbled upon that Demon \nQueen, yet? I hear she's quite the \nbeauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish \ngo, that is.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnWarriv": "90\nMay I remind you that my caravan can \nonly go east, if the Monastery is \ncleansed?\n",
 "A1Q6InitCain": "34\nIt is certain that we face the demon \nqueen, Andariel, who has corrupted the \nRogue Sisterhood and defiled their \nancestral Monastery. This does not \nbode well for us, my friend.\n \nAncient Horadric texts record that \nAndariel and the other Lesser Evils \nonce overthrew the three Prime Evils -- \nDiablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing \nthem from Hell to our world. Here, they \ncaused mankind untold anguish and \nsuffering before they were finally \nbound within the Soulstones.\n \nAndariel's presence here could mean \nthat the forces of Hell are once again \naligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. \nIf this is true, then I fear for us all.\n \nYou must kill her before the Monastery \nbecomes a permanent outpost of Hell \nand the way east lost forever.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulAkara": "64\nFinally, we may rejoice!\n \nWe owe you a debt we can never repay. \nI only hope that in time we will be able \nto rebuild our Order.\n \nAll our thanks go with you, my friend.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCain": "38\nThis is a great victory indeed, but many \nmore battles await. I will accompany \nyou on your journey, lending what \nassistance I can... \n \nRemember... Diablo is still out there, \nseeking something in the desert. I'm \nafraid that this nightmare will not end \nuntil you find what it is that he seeks.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCharsi": "86\nYou'll probably go east now... It was \ngood to know you. I hope you'll come \nback if you ever need anything.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulGheed": "100\nI'm going to party like it's 999!\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulKashya": "44\nAndariel's death brings about renewed \nlife for us all. We mourn the loss of our \ndear Sisters, but at least now we can \nget on with our lives.\n \nI... may have misjudged you, outlander. \nYou are a true hero and testament to \nthe noble spirit which has inspired our \nOrder for generations.\n \nFare well... my friend.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulWarriv": "82\nThe caravan is prepared. We may now \njourney eastward to Lut Gholein.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitAtma": "62\nThe creature makes its lair in the \ntunnels beneath this city. He butchered \nmy husband and son... I simply cannot \nbear to talk about it...\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitCain": "48\nThe Horadrim used to mummify their \nhighest mages, and infuse them with \nspells that would allow them to protect \ntheir tombs, even after death.\n \nI have no idea why one of them would \nbe acting so malevolently. Perhaps \nDrognan or Fara would know more \nabout this.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitDrognan": "53\nFara and I have been talking about the \ncreature recently. From my studies, I \nhave deduced that it is Radament the \nFallen, an ancient Horadric mummy \nthat has for some reason left his tomb \nto prey on mortals.\n \nI'm doing some more research now. If \nyou check back later, I may have some \nmore insight as to his nature.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitElzix": "68\nI hear that the creature kills his victims \nin order to hack off their limbs! I guess \nthat makes me a less likely candidate, \neh?\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitFara": "54\nI believe that the creature you refer to \nis one of the ancient Horadric \nmummies from the tombs that lie \nburied beneath the desert sands. It is \nunusual for one of his kind to be so far \naway from his resting place. I sense in \nthis entity a restless and malevolent \nspirit.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGeglash": "77\nHey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a \nhole into your skull with my thumb.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGreiz": "52\nI've personally found some of that \ndevil's victims washed up out of the \nsewer. Often, they are missing limbs or \na head, and their bodies have always \nbeen skinned.\n \nAt first the creature raided the town at \nnight... That's how Atma lost her \nfamily. Now we've got him barricaded \nin the sewers.\n \nYou're safe up here on the surface, but \nevery now and again some fool wants \nto be a hero and heads down to the \nwaste tunnels with a pig-sticker.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitLysander": "94\nI hear that beast is after body parts. \nDoes he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitMeshif": "63\nThere are two entrances to the sewers, \nI believe. One of them is right near \nhere, down by the water beneath the \ndocks. I can see it from my ship, and \nyou can bet I keep an eye on it every \nnight.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitWarrivAct2": "84\nI've heard tales of walking corpses out \nin the desert at night, though I've never \nactually seen one.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnAtma": "83\nI am starting to have second thoughts \nabout my request... I couldn't bear the \nthought of you losing your life on my \nbehalf.\n \nPlease be careful.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnCain": "41\nThe Horadric mummies were created to \nprotect the tombs, but Radament is far \nfrom his burial chamber. Given the \naberrations that have been witnessed \nlately, it comes as no surprise that \neven the ancient guardian spells have \nbegun to unravel. Be wary of this as \nyou venture farther into the desert.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnDrognan": "49\nI've just been reading something \ninteresting about this sort of undead. \nApparently, certain Horadric funereal \npriests altered the bodies of their dead \nmages with magical and surgical \ntechniques -- often replacing body \nparts with those of animals.\n \nThis was thought to augment their \npowers, and raise their status in the \nafterlife.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnElzix": "69\nIf you're going to fight that thing, use \nsome common sense. Be knowledgeable \nabout what harms the undead. Poison, \nfor instance, will have little effect.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnFara": "68\nDrognan told me something interesting \nearlier today. It might explain why \nRadament is so restless, and it might \nhave something to do with why he is \nstealing human body parts.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGeglash": "65\nAh-hah! Back for a small shot of \ncourage... Believe me, it doesn't help \nfor long.\n \nDrinks, barkeep!\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGreiz": "69\nWe've been meaning to send an \norganized group down there to kill that \nthing, but it would be dangerous. We \njust can't afford the chance of losing \nany men with all the trouble that's \ngoing on in the desert.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnLysander": "64\nHuh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, \nyes. Ooh, a foul creature...\n \nSome of my exploding potions should do \nquite nicely against him. They usually \nwork well against the undead.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnMeshif": "55\nI noticed a rotting, human arm floating \nin the harbor this morning. I suspected \nfoul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't \nseem too concerned since there haven't \nbeen any folk reported missing lately.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "90\nDeath is not afraid of the living, but the \nliving abhor death.\n",
 "A2Q1InitAtma": "50\nI don't expect this of you, but if you \nwant to help me, I would be grateful.\n \nIn the sewers below our city, there lurks \na horrid creature that hungers for \nhuman flesh. The creature has killed \nmany, including my son and my \nhusband.\n \nIf you destroy it, I will reward you. \nPlease be careful though, that beast \nhas taken enough from us already.\n \nThe sewer entrance is through the trap \ndoor just up the street.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulAtma": "50\nThey say that the taste of vengeance is \nbittersweet, but I find it to my liking. \n \nIn addition to my undying gratitude, I \nhave spoken on your behalf with the \nrest of the townspeople. The \nmerchants have agreed to show their \ngratitude by offering their wares and \nservices at lower rates.\n \nOh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. \nYou'll find him in front of the palace.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulCain": "57\nIf you haven't already, tell Atma that \nRadament is dead. It may help to ease \nthe weight of her mourning.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulDrognan": "52\nFrom what you tell me, it would seem \nthat Radament was bent on the task of \nreviving his own mummified corpse \nwith the flesh of the living.\n \nThis is very unusual indeed. It takes an \nincredible magic power to alter the \nsingular purpose of an undead mind.\n \nPerhaps there is a power at work here \nwhich is beyond my ken.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulElzix": "70\nWe ran into one of those old tomb \nguardians when I ran with my bandits. \nI know they aren't easy foes to face, so \nyou sure have my respect. Have you \ntold Atma yet?\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulFara": "102\nAs you have helped Atma and all of us, \nso shall I help you.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGeglash": "41\nWhoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?\n \nI've fallen off many a barstool and no \none calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They \nmight go so far as to say, 'Geglash, \nyou've fallen!'\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGreiz": "76\nYou've killed Radament, eh? That's quite \na nice piece of work! If you ever need a \njob as a mercenary, I'd be happy to \nsign ya' up.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulLysander": "61\nUh... Little of what I am able to hear is \nof any value. Radament's death, \nhowever, is news worth hearing. I'm \nsure Atma will be glad to hear of this.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulMeshif": "62\nGood job mate! At night out on my ship, \nI was often awakened by that fiend's \nawful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "142\nAtma's been telling everyone what \nyou've done for her.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCapCain": "50\nThe Viper Amulet you bear is actually \nthe headpiece of a Horadric Staff!\n \nYes... You have an uncanny knack for \nfinding rare and valuable artifacts. Of \ncourse, you'll have to use a Horadric \nCube to combine the headpiece with the \nshaft.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCubeCain": "40\nYou have quite a treasure there in that \nHoradric Cube. According to Horadric \nlore, the Cube can restore a Horadric \nStaff.\n \nTo do it - use the Cube as you would a \nscroll. When the Cube opens, place \nboth pieces of the Staff into it and use \nthe Cube's transmute power.\n \nYou'll be pleased to know that the Cube \nhas other alchemical uses as well...\n \nSix gems plus one sword transmute into \na socketed long sword.\n \nYou may also transmute two quivers of \ncrossbow bolts into one quiver of \narrows, while two quivers of arrows \nyield one quiver of bolts.\n \nI must leave it to you to discover other \nformulae.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnScrollCain": "37\nAhh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a \nfortunate turn of events...\n \nAs the last living Horadrim, I alone have \nknowledge of its meaning. Now, to read \nthe Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...\n \nThe Horadric Mages, after binding Baal \nwithin Tal Rasha, magically sealed off \nhis Burial Chamber from the mortal \nrealm. Those same Mages also crafted \nfearsome Horadric Staves and imbued \nthem with the special power to open \nthe Chamber's hidden door.\n \nAfter nearly losing one to the thievery \nof a rogue sorcerer, they divided all \nthe Horadric Staves into two parts - \nwooden shaft and metal headpiece - \nhiding them separately to safeguard \nthem.\n \nThe Horadrim foresaw our current \nplight and designed the hiding places \nto reveal themselves to worthy heroes \nlike you.\n \nCollect both parts of a Horadric Staff \nand unite them using a Horadric Cube. \nThen, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnStaveCain": "56\nThe Staff of Kings! You astound me, my \nfriend. You have discovered the shaft \nportion of a Horadric Staff.\n \nI trust you know how to use a Horadric \nCube to unite the shaft with its \nheadpiece.\n",
 "A2Q2SuccessfulStaffCain": "46\nExcellent! You have a Horadric Staff.\n \nCarry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. \nFind within the Tomb the chamber \nwhose floor is inset with the Circle of \nSeven Symbols.\n \nPlace the Staff into the receptacle you \nfind there. That will open the secret \npassage into Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n \nBut, be prepared for a fight - you'll \nlikely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy \nBaal.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitAtma": "121\nDrognan, the wizard, will have some \nidea as to what is happening.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitCain": "62\nDrognan may have some advice on this \nmatter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with \nhim myself.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitDrognan": "77\nI've been researching this lengthy \neclipse and I believe it to be the work \nof Claw Vipers.\n \nFind their temple beneath the desert \nsands and you may find the source of \nthis curse.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitElzix": "65\nTwo men arrived late last night bearing \na story about evil magic. They said \nthey saw a gathering of giant snake \ncreatures performing some arcane \nritual. They sound like the Serpent Men \nof the desert.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitFara": "70\nThis unnatural nightfall is no doubt \ncaused by evil sorcery. Drognan might \nknow what we are dealing with.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGeglash": "100\nThis whole place is one big ale fog.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGreiz": "71\nThis midday darkness reeks of foul \nmagic! My men and I are trying to keep \nthe peace, but this kind of thing really \nscares people.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitJerhyn": "110\nMy astrologers failed to predict this \neclipse. You should seek Drognan's \nadvice.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitLysander": "65\nClaw Vipers! This outer darkness \nmirrors the inner blackness of their \nsouls. It is they who have eclipsed the \nsun, I'll wager. They are a venomous \nband.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitMeshif": "76\nThis permanent darkness is very \nunsettling. Hmmm... It would make \nnavigation by stars easier for me, \nthough.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitWarrivAct2": "72\nThe sun has grown disgusted with the \nterrible deeds it must shine upon each \nday. Damnation is upon us all.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnAtma": "80\nI was going to go to bed, but then I \nrealized that I have no idea what time \nit is. It could be the crack of dawn, for \nall I know.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57\nThe source of this spell is probably a \nmagical altar. It will not be enough to \nkill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the \nspell you must destroy the altar.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnDrognan": "51\nI've discovered a reference to a similar \neclipse several hundred years ago. It \nsays that some desert-dwelling snake \ndemons had erected an evil altar, \nwhich caused the sun to go black.\n \nPerhaps we are dealing with something \nsimilar here. Look for an altar in the \nClaw Viper temple.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnElzix": "94\nI usually charge for rooms by the night.\n \nBut I may have to soon change that.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnFara": "77\nThe Claw Vipers practice evil magic. \nThey have also been known to kidnap \ntravelers and sacrifice them to their \ndark gods.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGeglash": "49\nIt's strange when the morning after the \nnight before... is still the same night.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGreiz": "73\nDon't worry! My men and I have an iron \ngrip on this town. If those cursed Claw \nVipers are plotting anything against \nus, we'll be prepared for 'em.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnJerhyn": "130\nThis eclipse is a definite manifestation \nof evil.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnLysander": "82\nWell... I don't know much about the \nhabits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. \nDrognan will probably know something \nabout the nature of the magic at work.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnMeshif": "105\nI've had about enough of this darkness. \nI don't even know what day it is \nanymore.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "73\nThe calculated coldness of the reptilian \nbrain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny \nadversaries.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulAtma": "132\nYou have done well to restore light to \nour world.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulCain": "48\nI've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and \nI sense that he is becoming more and \nmore agitated by something. You \nshould try to talk to him again.\n \nIf he still won't take you into his \nconfidence, seek to prove yourself a bit \nmore. I gather that his respect for you \nis growing.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulDrognan": "69\nYou did well in destroying the Claw \nVipers. We are all glad to see the sun \nreturned to its former glory.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulElzix": "74\nAhh... It takes but one eye to revel in \nthe beauty of our restored sun.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulFara": "87\nDrognan seems to have taken you into \nhis confidence. This is good, for you \nwill benefit from his wisdom.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nSo, this is daylight... It's over-rated.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulGreiz": "219\nI'm glad that's over with!\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulJerhyn": "96\nThe sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm \nbeginning to like you, traveler.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulLysander": "69\nAhhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical \nartifacts. Did you happen to find one in \ntheir temple?\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulMeshif": "130\nSo... Did you plunder any booty?\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "80\nWith renewed daylight, one may gather \nthe wits that were scattered about like \nrestrictive undergarments in the \ndarkness.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitAtma": "75\nArcane Sanctuary? That place sounds \nawful! Even if you find a way into it, \nwhat makes you think you'll be able to \nleave again?\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitCain": "45\nI very much doubt that Horazon still \nlives in his Sanctuary. He possessed \ngreat power and influence over \ndemons, but even that may not have \nbeen enough in the end. One of his \nnotoriety cannot easily remove himself \nfrom the vengeful reach of Hell.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitDrognan": "42\nNearly a thousand years ago, Horazon \nrose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage \nclan. Horazon used the knowledge of \nthe Vizjerei to summon and control \ndemons from Hell.\n \nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon \nfeared that the Lords of Hell would \npunish him for enslaving their \nbrethren. Thus, the Summoner created \nfor himself an Arcane Sanctuary.\n \nHe believed that his Sanctuary would \nnot only protect him from Hell's \nvengeance, but also allow him to \ncontinue his studies free from the \nravages of time and disease.\n \nHorazon had crafted many wondrous \nscrying devices through which he \nobserved the events of the world \noutside. It is certain that he took \ncareful study of Tal Rasha's \nimprisonment and recorded the \nlocation of his forgotten Tomb.\n \nThe Arcane Sanctuary was believed to \nhave been constructed here in Lut \nGholein. An entrance may be hidden \nsomewhere in the palace, as that \nbuilding is very old, and was once a \nVizjerei fortress.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitElzix": "62\nAn 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the \npalace? I'd heard that there were some \nunderground cellar levels that Jerhyn \nused as chambers for his treasure and \nsuch, but no Arcane Sanctuary.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitFara": "46\nAh, the ancient mage Horazon! He \nbelieved that he could bend Evil forces \nto his will. What he didn't know was \nthat Evil uses man, not the reverse.\n \nThe Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol \nof man's ability to triumph over other \nworldly forces. The Church of Light, \nhowever, cites him as an example of \nman's folly.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGeglash": "60\nLook, look... I'm just about as tough and \narrogant as they come, but you'd never \ncatch me trying to tame a demon for a \npet. That's just asking for a lot of \ntrouble.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGreiz": "89\nThe only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the \nharem girls that have been hiding there \nsince the troubles began.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitJerhyn": "44\nWhen the troubles began here, I allowed \nthe terrified Harem guilds to join me \nwithin the safety of the palace. All was \nfine, until one night...\n \nScreams echoed up the stairwells from \nthe harem. My guards arrived to find \nthe poor girls being slaughtered by a \nmerciless band of hell-spawned \ndemons. My brave guardsmen tried to \npush the demons back into the \nmysterious rift from which they came.\n \nEver since, my men have fought a losing \nbattle. Demons have continued to pour \nthrough the rift into the palace. \nUltimately, I hired Greiz and his \nmercenaries to help protect the rest of \nmy fair city.\n \nDrognan believes that the Arcane \nSanctuary lies buried underneath this \npalace, since Lut Gholein occupies the \nsite of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.\n \nMy palace is open to you now... Take \ncare.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitLysander": "49\nHorazon found it necessary to lock \nhimself up for all time, just to protect \nhimself from those angry demons. \nSuch is the fate of one who practices \nthe summoning arts... that, or eternal \ndamnation. There's old summoners and \nbold summoners, but no old, bold \nsummoners.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitMeshif": "57\nAhh... The legend of Horazon is an old \none, especially around these parts. You \nwouldn't believe the feats and strange \nevents that are attributed to him.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitWarrivAct2": "73\nA careful caravan gives wide berth to \nsleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, \nlet him remain so.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnAtma": "87\nSo you've been in the palace, have you? \nTell me, why does Jerhyn keep that \nplace locked up so tight?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnCain": "51\nI've been thinking about the problems in \nJerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has \noccurred to you as well...\n \nIf those cellar passageways lead to the \nArcane Sanctuary, then that is where \nthe demons came from. Horazon's \nhaven must have been breached!\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnDrognan": "63\nI am certain that you will find the \ninformation you need when you find \nHorazon's Journal. I suggest you find it \nquickly, for Diablo may be getting \ncloser to freeing his brother as we \nspeak.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnElzix": "63\nI understand that you've been talking to \nJerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first \nin a long while... since the trouble \nbegan, actually.\n \nDo us a favor and try to find out what's \ngot Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnFara": "57\nEven a sanctuary such as Horazon's \ncan be breached by the tentacles of \nEvil. Such a haven could have become a \nchamber of unspeakable horrors. Be \nwary of what you may unleash!\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGeglash": "49\nAll my years of brawling, of pummeling \nboth the unsuspecting and the \ndeserving, have yielded two insights. \nYou can either fight or you can run. All \nother strategies are variations of \nthese.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGreiz": "61\nWhat's got you so occupied in the \npalace? Don't tell me you're finding the \nHarems more compelling than killing \ndemons? That would be out of \ncharacter for one such as yourself.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnJerhyn": "48\nThere was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, \nI believe... who visited me almost a \nyear ago. He was very interested in the \nhistory of this site, and he seemed \nparticularly fascinated with the palace \narchitecture.\n \nI gave him a tour. When he found the \nancient seals over a passageway in the \ncellar, he became very agitated. He \nasked for some time alone to study \nthem, and I granted it.\n \nShortly after, he left with no further \nword and I never saw him again. Odd... \nDon't you think?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnLysander": "68\nHuh? The horizon is always out of \nreach, you should know that. Oh, \nHorazon! Oh, I see. Uh.\n \nYes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, \nbut... total lunatic.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnMeshif": "77\nSo... Now that you're such a pal of \nJerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can \nset sail one of these days? I'm running \nout of patience.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "87\nFate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt \nyou with dung if you mock it.\n",
 "A2Q4InitDrognan": "41\nI've been researching the old records, \ntrying to find the location of Tal \nRasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found \nthe Tomb, itself, I may have a good \nlead for you.\n \nThe great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, \nbuilt his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere \naround here. He was a powerful \nspellcaster and kept demons as slaves \nwithin the Sanctuary. He kept a close \neye on great events, too -- such as the \nimprisonment of Baal within Tal \nRasha's Tomb.\n \nIf you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, \nI'm sure that it would hold some clue \nas to the Tomb's location. Though I \ndoubt Horazon is still alive, you must \nproceed with caution. There's no telling \nwhat could be waiting inside.\n \nWhen I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, \nhe asked that I send you to him. \nPerhaps he knows of a secret entrance \nor the like.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulAtma": "62\nOh, those poor women! Will the \nslaughter never end? Thank you once \nagain for protecting our city.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulCain": "57\nYou must move quickly now, friend, for \nDiablo is undoubtedly close to finding \nwhat he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal \nRasha before he frees the Lord of \nDestruction.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulDrognan": "55\nYou have found Horazon's Journal. \nExcellent... But, I must caution you.\n \nThe mark of the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha, is sought, if not already known, \nby Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the \nimplications of that.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulElzix": "71\nNews of the tragedy in the palace is \nspreading fast. How awful! And to \nthink, this whole time I thought Jerhyn \nand his guards were in there playing \nwith the harem girls.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulFara": "64\nFaith is stronger than any armor. The \nshield will protect the body, but Faith \nwill strengthen the courageous heart.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nHah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the \npalace. I would've saved those girls and \nkicked demon ass back to the fire-pits \no' Hell!\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGriez": "59\nUnbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! \nThe palace guards have been fighting \noff demons from the cellar. How could \nthat happen without my knowledge?\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulJerhyn": "62\nI thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also \nglad that you found something you \nwere looking for. The journal should \nhelp you find the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha. Hopefully, there is still time to \nget there before Diablo.\n \nGo now. And good luck.\n",

 "A2Q4SuccessfulMeshif": "52\nSo... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. \nWell... I guess I can see why he wanted \nme to stay, though... I'm just glad it \ndidn't come to that. Now he tells me to \nwait some more, in case you need to \nget out of here.\n \nWell, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll \nmention me in the epic ballads, eh?\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulNarrator": "37\nSeekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will \nfind it through the Portal. But know \nthat the glowing glyphs recorded here \nin my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs \nof the six False Tombs.\n \nThe missing Seventh Sign marks the \nTomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim \nhe might be called the foremost.\n \nIt was a shining - but brief - moment for \nthe Mage Clans when they set aside \ntheir differences and worked together \nagainst the common enemy.\n \nThe Horadrim relentlessly pursued the \nThree across the desolate Empires of \nthe East, and even into the uncharted \nlands of the West, leaving the \nArchangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.\n \nPresuming the Three to be vanquished, \nthe Horadrim's unstable fellowship \nbegan to dissipate. Abandoning their \nsacred charge to safeguard the three \nSoulstones, the disparate Mage Clans \nbegan to squabble amongst each other \nover petty differences.\n \nTheir conflicts not only dissolved their \nbrotherhood, but strengthened the \nEvils which they had buried beneath the \ncold earth.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "67\nWell, the news going around town is \nvery unsettling. Apparently, we were in \nmore danger than anyone thought.\n \nGood work friend... you may have saved \nall our skins.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnAtma": "105\nYou always seem to find the worst \ntrouble. I don't know how you handle it.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnCain": "45\nThe appearance of the mage you \ndescribe sounds like one I met back in \nTristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight \nagainst Diablo, the Lord of Terror. \nPerhaps, this is one of them.\n \nYou know, fate seems to have frowned \nupon all of the heroes who confronted \nthat terrible Evil. Take care or the \nsame may happen to you.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnDrognan": "47\nYes... The man you speak of sounds like \nthe mage who came here many months \nago. He claimed to have fought Diablo \nin the passages beneath Tristram.\n \nNo doubt the fool wandered into \nHorazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever \nwas left of his ravaged mind. He is \nbeyond salvation. \n \nIt is possible that the fool has been \npossessed by the spirit of Horazon. If \nthat's true, then you'd better put an \nend to his tortured existence.\n \nOnce done, I believe the demons who \nwere summoned and imprisoned within \nthe Sanctuary will cease to exist as \nwell.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnElzix": "106\nUgh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.\n \nJust kill him and get on with your \nbusiness.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnFara": "63\nHmmm... That doesn't sound like \nHorazon. I'll agree that he may have \ngone mad, but from what you tell me, I \ndon't think that's the case. Talk to \nDrognan... he may know more than I.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGeglash": "38\nSo! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be \nsurprised if he wasn't. All those \ncenturies without ale would drive \nanyone to drink... but then you couldn't \ndrink. And that would drive you to \ndrink... Hah?... What was the question?\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGreiz": "89\nThat guy really talks like that? Sounds \nlike either Horazon has gone stir-crazy \nor that's some impostor.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnJerhyn": "57\nThe man you describe is probably not \nHorazon.\n \nHe sounds like the very mage who came \naround here a while ago. He was very \ncurious about this palace and seemed \nespecially interested in the seal on the \npassageway in the cellar. He left \nshortly after that. I wonder how he got \ndown there? The seal was never \nbroken...\n \nThat mage spoke a great deal to \nDrognan. Why don't you ask him about \nit?\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnLysander": "57\nAh, yes. I remember. There was a... \nfellow around here many months ago \nwho asked almost as many questions \nabout Horazon as you.\n \nSo... He discovered enough to assume \nHorazon's place in the Arcane \nSanctuary, huh? What a fool!\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnMeshif": "72\nAh, yes. As a ship captain I am well \naware of the phenomenon of a false \nHorazon.\n \nSorry, just a little joke.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "99\nThere's nothing more dreadful than a \npowerful being driven by a frayed \nmind.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulAtma": "89\nYou're more the hero than I could have \ndreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us \nafter all.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulCain": "48\nI hope that this false Summoner found \npeace in death. Unfortunately, it is \nmore likely that he will be dragged \ndown into Hell by the demons he was \nbound to.\n \nLet this be a lesson to you... Demonic \nmagic is a quick path, but its powers \nare seductive and deadly.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulDrognan": "83\nLarger forces are moving inexorably \ntowards us. You must now make haste \nto the Tombs.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulElzix": "65\nYou make me long for the days of glory. \nWhen I had both hands, both eyes and \nmore of a foot...\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulFara": "74\nI feel no pity for that would-be \nSummoner. His terrible ambition for \ndemonic power was his undoing. You \nmerely hastened the inevitable.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nThe way I see it... Well, it's all pretty \nblurry.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGreiz": "76\nSo, Horazon's been dead for some time. \nI take it you at least found what you \nwere looking for.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulJerhyn": "63\nThe demonic force that was emanating \nfrom the corrupted Sanctuary has \ndissipated. I thank you greatly for your \nhelp. Now, we can look to rebuilding \nour lives.\n \nAll will be for nothing, though, if you do \nnot stop the greater Evil which is \nrapidly gaining ground.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulLysander": "103\nHuhhh... Such is always the fate of \nthose who meddle with evil.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulMeshif": "100\nWell! You've got what you're after. Now \nget a move on before it's too late.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "84\nI guess you'll be heading to the Tombs \nnow? I hear that they're in the deepest \ndesert regions.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitAtma": "67\nI've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal \nRasha, but I thought they were just old \ntales meant to scare young children.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitCain": "57\nDiablo nears his goal. We have little \ntime to lose.\n \nRemember, my friend, that Andariel \ngave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. \nIt would be prudent to assume that the \nother Evils will attempt to aid their \nmaster as well.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitDrognan": "55\nTal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the \ndesert among six others. Tal Rasha's \nsymbol marks the True Tomb. If you \nwant to know what that symbol is, you \nshould be able to find it within the \nlegendary Arcane Sanctuary.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitElzix": "59\nSo... You're going to search for the \nSeven Tombs, huh? Don't you know \nthat they're just desert legends passed \nbetween merchants and travelers? No \none really believes that they exist.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitFara": "57\nLegend has it that Tal Rasha lies \nimprisoned within his tomb, forever \nstruggling to keep the Lord of \nDestruction bound. His was a selfless \nact, although perhaps foolhardy.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGeglash": "59\nOhh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... \nBut... umm... I don't like all that living \ndead stuff.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGreiz": "106\nIf you're going into the deep desert, why \nnot hire a few of my men to watch your \nback?\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitJerhyn": "53\nIt is well-known that there are seven \ngreat Horadric tombs hidden beneath \nthe sands in the furthest reaches of \nthe desert. One of them surely must be \nTal Rasha's prison. You must explore \neach of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's \nexact location.\n \nOf course, Diablo is searching for the \nTomb as well... No one can guess as to \nwhat terrors he has unleashed in his \nsearch.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitLysander": "56\nWhen Tal Rasha chose to embody the \nspirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to \nwrestle eternally against the will of the \ngreater Evil. Look around you and ask \nyourself, 'Has the battle been won or \nlost?'\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitMeshif": "84\nI'm sorry, I can't help you much here. \nNow, if the tombs were across the \nocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitWarrivAct2": "61\nBe very careful, my friend. I think I've \nseen enough recently not to doubt that \nthese Tombs exist. And if they do, \nthey're most certainly guarded by \nterrible creatures.\n",
 "A2Q6InitJerhyn": "45\nI have heard of your many deeds of skill \nand bravery. I feel I can trust you with \nsomething I have been hesitant to \nspeak of...\n \nDrognan and I have concluded that the \nDark Wanderer who passed through \nhere recently was Diablo, himself! \nDrognan believes that Diablo is \nsearching the desert for the secret \ntomb where the great Horadric mage, \nTal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.\n \nYou must find Diablo and put an end to \nthe terrible evil that has fallen upon \nour city. Drognan is wise and is sure to \nhave some helpful advice for you as to \nhow Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.\n \nIt may take you quite some time to find \nThe Tomb. May you be ready when you \ndo.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulAtma": "64\nYou have proven to be the greatest of \nheroes, and I am honored to call you \nfriend. Thank you for bringing peace to \nour lives again.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulCain": "39\nThe Archangel Tyrael was the one who \ngave the Soulstones to the Horadrim \ntwo hundred and sixty years ago.\n \nIt is highly unusual for the forces of \nHeaven to so directly interfere with \nman's destiny, but Tyrael was said to \nact of his own volition. We have never \nbeen able to discern why.\n \nPerhaps, he goes against the consensus \nof Heaven because he doubts our \nability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, \nhe sees more threat than his peers.\n \nWhere the actions of Hell often seem \nstraightforwardly bent on destruction, \nthe motives of Heaven are \nunfathomable.\n \nNow make haste... Both Diablo and Baal \nmust be stopped before they join with \ntheir brother, Mephisto. If the three \nPrime Evils unite once again, the world \nas we know it will be no more.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulDrognan": "51\nThis is a serious setback... It is most \nunfortunate that Tal Rasha has been \nconsumed by Baal's destructive \ninfluence. There are many secrets \nknown to the Horadrim, which could be \nused by Baal against us.\n \nYou must travel east by sea to Kurast \nand stop Diablo and Baal before they \nfree their eldest brother, Mephisto.\n \nHahh... The lands of the eastern Empire \nare not the same as they used to be. \nThere has been little word for some \ntime.\n \nSpeed is of the essence. Go quickly, my \nfriend. May the fates smile on you.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulElzix": "71\nI heard that Diablo has managed to \nbest you, at least for the time being. I \nhope you catch up with him soon, and \nsend him back to Hell for good!\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulFara": "46\nThis is terrible news! Baal is in \npossession of one of mankind's most \npowerful mages, and the Lord of Terror \nguides his path. They must be stopped, \nfor I am sure they mean to free their \nelder brother Mephisto, the Lord of \nHatred, who lies imprisoned under the \ncorrupted city of Kurast.\n \nI fear you are walking into a great evil, \nbut your faith can save you. May you \nwalk in the light always.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGeglash": "54\nYou're an inspiration! And such a hero \nthat it makes me look twice as bad...\n \nAhh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some \nglory for us little guys, huh?\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGreiz": "51\nI've heard that your foe got away from \nyou this time. Well, look at it this way... \nyou've got the demons on the run. If \nyou're going to be leaving, then... Well, \nthanks for your help.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulJerhyn": "47\nYou have done very well. Few could have \ncome this far, let alone discover the \nTrue Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, \nI hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded \nyour grasp. This is most unfortunate...\n \nIf you wish to travel East, I have \nauthorized Meshif to give you passage \nby sea. I imagine he should be very \nanxious to leave by now.\n \nGood luck on your quest, and thank you \nagain for saving my beloved city. You \nwill always be welcome in Lut Gholein, \nmy friend.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulLysander": "70\nI'm sorry things didn't turn out as you \nhad hoped. Go and remember us \nfondly. You know, you bothered me far \nless than most.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulMeshif": "82\nJerhyn tells me I should take you east to \nKurast. I haven't been there for several \nyears, but rumor has it that things are \npretty grim.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "68\nNever fear, my friend. You did the best \nyou could.\n \nI suspect that Diablo and Baal are now \nheading east, towards Kurast. You'll \nfind them... I know you will.\n",
 "A3Q1AfterInitAlkor": "73\nThe Black Book contains powerful \nsecrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, \nlong eclipsed by Zakarum.\n \nI should warn you. The Black Book is \nmuch sought after by both good and \nevil. Be wary.\n",

 "A3Q1AfterInitCainAct3": "72\nThe Black Book is a powerful source of \ninformation. The Zakarum will do \neverything in their power to stop you \nfrom obtaining it.\n",
 "A3Q1AfterInitHratli": "54\nWe have long sought the Black Book of \nLam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts \nspread as fast as jungle plagues. If you \nfind it, take it to Alkor.\n",
 "A3Q1AfterInitMeshifAct3": "73\nOh. No one really believes that the Black \nBook exists. It's just a symbol of \nZakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.\n",
 "A3Q1AfterInitNatalya": "81\nI've heard of the Black Book. My Order's \ncode is based on many of its passages. \nIf you find it, I will be greatly \nimpressed.\n",
 "A3Q1AfterInitOrmus": "62\nThe Children of Zakarum believe that \nthe Black Book is filled with \nblasphemous heresy. In truth, the book \nmay contain the secrets to our ultimate \nredemption.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnAlkor": "104\nDid I neglect to mention that the book \ncontains useful information about the \nPrime Evils?\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnAsheara": "68\nI believe I can trust you now.\n \nWhen you first arrived, I suspected you \na spy for the Zakarum, the false \nreligion whose faithful are now under \nthe sway of a mysterious power. \nThey've made a mockery of the Old \nReligion of Skatsim.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnCainAct3": "81\nI heard that there are ruined temples in \nKurast. Perhaps you will find the Black \nBook in one of them.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnHratli": "62\nNot getting much help?\n \nYou know, people are like rugs. Hang \nthem out a window and shake 'em a \ncouple times. You'll be surprised how \nmuch dirt comes out.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "56\nKurast was once the greatest city in the \nworld. Now it is hard to tell where the \njungle stops and the city begins. The \njungle grows rampant on the soil \nenriched by the blood of my fellow \ncitizens.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnNatalya": "105\nI hope you find the Black Book soon. I \ncould use something to read while I \nwait for my orders.\n",
 "A3Q1EarlyReturnOrmus": "55\nEven if you find the sacred Book, you \nmust still traverse the jungle of \nmeaning within it. That journey could \nprove to be far more perilous.\n",
 "A3Q1InitAlkor": "56\nIt pains me to waste time with you, so \nI'll get right to the point.\n \nThere is a very special book which you \nmust find for me. It was written long \nago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who \nstudied Skatsimi magic and the effects \nof the Prime Evils on the mortal world. \nThe Black Book was lost when the \nChildren of Zakarum took over this \nland.\n \nNow, you must reclaim it without delay! \nIts knowledge may aid us in this dark \ntime ahead.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulAlkor": "83\nYou have found the Book! It should give \nall of us here some insight into the \nnature of the Prime Evils...\n \nAh, but as for you...\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulAsheara": "135\nThe Iron Wolves are very impressed by \nyour skills.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulCainAct3": "86\nYou have found a source of information \npowerful enough to turn the tide \nagainst the Zakarum.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulHratli": "74\nWe have the Book. Now we must see if \nwe can bear its revelations.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "75\nThank all that's holy. You've returned \nwith the Black Book! Maybe now you \ncan put an end to the Evil that has \ndestroyed my homeland.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulNatalya": "89\nSo, you've returned with the Book. You \nsurprise me. You must be very \nresourceful.\n",
 "A3Q1SuccessfulOrmus": "70\nWhy is the Black Book of Lam Esen like \na coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape \nof our future.\n",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnBrainCain": "58\nThis is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain \nknows Mephisto's weakness.\n \nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with \nKhalim's other relics - the Eye, the \nHeart, and the Flail.\n",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnEyeCain": "52\nAhh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal \nthe true path to Mephisto.\n \nPlace the Eye in the Horadric Cube \nalong with Khalim's other relics - the \nHeart, the Brain, and the Flail.\n",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnFlailCain": "46\nOnce properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can \ndestroy the Compelling Orb and reveal \nthe way to Mephisto.\n \nPlace it into the Horadric Cube along \nwith Khalim's relics - his Heart, his \nBrain, and his Eye. Then, transmute \nthem to carry out Khalim's Will.\n",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnHeartCain": "61\nYou have found Khalim's Heart, and it \nstill bears the courage to face \nMephisto!\n \nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with \nKhalim's other relics - the Eye, the \nBrain, and the Flail.\n",
 "A3Q2InitCain": "33\nNever forget that your ultimate purpose \nhere in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. \nThe ancient Horadrim imprisoned the \nLord of Hatred inside the Guardian \nTower that is located within the Temple \nCity of Travincal.\n \nKnow this, friend. The only way to gain \nentry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy \nthe artifact known as the Compelling \nOrb.\n \nMephisto used this device to control the \nZakarum Priests and their followers. \nThe Orb can only be destroyed with an \nancient flail imbued with the spirit of \nthe one incorruptible priest.\n \nSoon after his imprisonment, Mephisto \nworked his evil corruption on the \nZakarum priesthood. All were turned to \nhis dark ways, save one - Khalim, the \nQue-Hegan of the High Council.\n \nMephisto directed the other Council \npriests to slay and dismember Khalim \nand then scatter his remains across \nthe Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur \nsucceeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, \neventually becoming the embodiment of \nMephisto here on the mortal plane.\n \nThe corrupted High Council fashioned \nan Orb to control the rest of the \nZakarum faithful and used their powers \nto hide the lair of their master from \nmortals.\n \nYour task is to collect the scattered \nrelics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, \nand his Eye. Then, using the Horadric \nCube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his \nrelics.\n \nOnce this is accomplished, you must \ndestroy the Compelling Orb with \nKhalim's Will to open the way into the \ncorrupt sanctum of Mephisto.\n",
 "A3Q2SuccessfulCain": "54\nMasterfully done, hero! You have \ncrafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to \ndestroy the Compelling Orb and open \nthe way to Mephisto. \n \nMay the true Light guide your way.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitAlkor": "66\nHave you not heard of the Gidbinn? \nWell, allow me to reduce your \nignorance on the subject.\n \nThe Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a \nreligious artifact greatly valued by the \nOld Religion, Skatsim.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitAsheara": "107\nThe Gidbinn will reinforce the \nenchantments that protect the \ndockside from the evil that infests \nKurast.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitCainAct3": "55\nI've done some research on the Taan \nmage-clan, and it seems that most of \ntheir magical studies were focused on \nSkatsimi rites.\n \nIf anyone is qualified to use the powers \nof the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitHratli": "54\nAs far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the \npossession of the Children of Light. \nThey do not wish it to fall into the \nhands of those who can restore its \npowers.\n \nYou may not believe it, but Ormus is the \none who can use the Gidbinn to protect \nus.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitMeshifAct3": "66\nThe Gidbinn is one of the few remaining \nrelics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is \nreputed to have great powers.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitNatalya": "73\nDon't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. \nThough it is only a small dagger, it \nholds tremendous power when in the \nhands of a true Skatsimi mage.\n",
 "A3Q3AfterInitOrmus": "64\nOrmus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But \nhow would a powerful Skatsimi artifact \naid an unbeliever like you?\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnAlkor": "70\nLegend has it that the Skatsimi priests \nplaced great power within the small \nblade. Power enough to repel this \nterrible jungle-curse which encroaches \non our sanctuary.\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnAsheara": "145\nI'm certain that the Gidbinn is very \nclosely guarded.\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnCainAct3": "75\nSince you haven't come across the \nGidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper \nin the jungle nearer Kurast.\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnHratli": "70\nOnce the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will \nuse it to strengthen the protective \nbarrier around the dockside.\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnMeshifAct3": "67\nThe jungle is like nothing you've ever \nseen before. Imagine Paradise \nfestering like a wound... then bursting!\n",
 "A3Q3EarlyReturnNatalya": "97\nYou'd best get back out there and find \nthat blade. The jungle creeps further \ninto this camp by the hour.\n",

 "A3Q3InitHratli": "45\nAs I told you before, I placed an \nenchantment upon the dockside in \norder to keep the demons at bay.

 "A3Q3SuccessfulAsheara": "99\nNow that fewer of the Iron Wolves are \nneeded to guard the dockside, some of \nthem have volunteered to accompany \nyou free of charge.\n",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulCainAct3": "62\nWho could have foreseen that the Old \nReligion would play such an effective \nrole in our war against the Three? \nAgain, your efforts amaze me, my \nfriend.\n",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulHratli": "80\nThe Gidbinn's magic can only be \nchanneled through Ormus.\n \nTake it to him. He has the necessary \nknowledge about the ancient Skatsimi \nmagics.\n",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulMeshifAct3": "79\nWith any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will \ngrant us revenge upon the powers that \nravaged this land.\n",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulNatalya": "67\nYou are truly amazing, stranger. There \nare precious few items in the world \nthat would tempt me to go up against \nthe Children of Zakarum and their \nmidget minions.\n",
 "A3Q3SuccessfulOrmus": "41\nYou have done well, noble hero. Ormus \ncongratulates you. The old spirits of \nSkatsim will watch over you for \nreturning their sacred blade.\n \nNow, after all these years, Ormus will \nonce again use his powers to protect \nthe innocent from the shadow.

 "A3Q4AfterInitAlkor": "73\nAh, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank \nyou, my friend. \n \nBusy yourself while I experiment with \nthe ashes within it. Then, return and \nsee what I have made for you.\n",
 "A3Q4AfterInitHratli": "50\nKu Y'leh was a powerful sage who was \nrumored to have brewed a potion of \nimmortality. In an ironic twist of fate, \nhe was murdered before his potent \nelixir could take effect.\n",
 "A3Q4AfterInitNatalya": "78\nDon't tell me you believe in all of that \n'life after death' nonsense. You should \nbe more concerned with avoiding death \nthan making plans for after it finds \nyou.\n",
 "A3Q4AfterInitOrmus": "51\nKu Y'leh, in searching for immortal \nyouth, found only an early death. His \napprentices, seeking to live forever, \nburned his body in order to derive \nbenefit from his ashes.\n",

 "A3Q4Init1CainAct3": "53\nBack in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he \nhad a fondness for jade figurines. On \nhis trading voyages he collected an odd \nassortment of such small statues.\n \nI would show him your figurine. \n",
 "A3Q4Init2MeshifAct3": "73\nPraise you! That jade figurine will \ncomplete the set I was collecting.\n \nHere! I've had this statuette of a golden \nbird for years, but I consider it a fair \nexchange.\n",

 "A4Q1InitTyrael": "42\nThere is a dark, tortured soul who was \ntrapped within this forsaken realm long \nago. He was called Izual by mortal \nmen, and in ages past he was my most \ntrusted Lieutenant.\n \nYet, against my wishes he led an \nill-fated assault upon the fiery \nHellforge, itself.\n \nDespite his valor and strength, Izual \nwas captured by the Prime Evils and \ntwisted by their perverse power. They \nforced him to betray his own kind and \ngive up Heaven's most guarded \nsecrets.\n \nHe became a corrupt shadow of his \nformer self - a fallen angel trusted \nneither by Heaven nor Hell.\n \nFor his transgressions, Izual's spirit \nwas bound within the form of a terrible \ncreature which was summoned from \nthe Abyss. His maddened spirit has \nresided within that tortured husk for \nmany ages now.\n \nIt seems to me that he has suffered \nlong enough. I implore you, hero, find \nIzual and release him from his cruel \nimprisonment.\n \nPut an end to his guilt and suffering.\n",

Now the Stones' powers \nare corrupted.\n \nWith the combined powers of the \nSoulstones under their control, the \nPrime Evils will be able to turn the \nmortal world into a permanent outpost \nof Hell!\n",

 "A5Q1InitLarzuk": "45\nIf you're here to defeat Baal, you must \nprove it!\n \nAs we speak, Harrogath is under siege \nby Baal's demons.

A ruthless taskmaster, \nhe lashes his own minions into suicidal \nfrenzies on the battlefield.\n \nIf you wish to prove yourself to us, \ndestroy the monster, Shenk, that \ncommands those infernal catapults \noutside Harrogath.

 "A5Q2SuccessfulCain": "80\nYou've become a hero to this town, my \nfriend. The shadows have lifted ever \nsince you brought the Light to \nHarrogath.\n",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulLarzuk": "55\nSince your arrival, Cain has spoken of \nyour deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, \ndefeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At \nfirst, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm \nfinding them more believable with every \npassing day.\n",
 "A5Q2SuccessfulMalah": "73\nYou have inspired the people in this \ntown -- not only those you rescued, but \nthose you've helped in other ways as \nwell.\n",

 "A5Q2SuccessfulQualKehk": "51\nThank you for rescuing my men. They \nhave spoken well of your bravery in \nbattle. Perhaps there is hope for us \nafter all. \n \nIf you wish, you may hire some of my \nmercenaries that you saved. And \nplease...take this set of runes.

 "A5Q3AfterInitCain": "59\nI would listen to Malah. Nihlathak \nspeaks with a venomous tongue and \nacts as if the entire weight of this town \nrests upon his shoulders.\n \nPerhaps there is more going on here \nthan we know.\n",
 "A5Q3AfterInitLarzuk": "57\nAnya is an amazing alchemist, \nespecially for her young age. As long \nas I've known her, she's never let \nanything stop her from pursuing what \nshe believed in. \n \nI wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is \ninvolved. Ever since her father died, \nthey haven't gotten along.\n",
 "A5Q3AfterInitMalah": "94\nWhen you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. \nThere is no telling what he will say or \ndo.\n",
 "A5Q3AfterInitNihlathak": "41\nAnya! Who have you been talking to? \nLikely it was that meddling Malah. \n \nWell, I'll tell you what really happened. \nAnya came to me for guidance, after \nreceiving a vision that her mother and \nyounger brother were trapped in the \nlands beyond the Ice Caves. She had \ndecided to go rescue them. \n \nI told her that her quest was a foolish \none and that she would be safer \nstaying within the city walls. However, \nshe is a willful girl and would not listen \nto me. \n \nThe next morning, she was gone. No \none is more distraught than I over \nlosing her. \n \nHowever, if you feel the need to be \nMalah's errand child, I won't try to stop \nyou.\n",
 "A5Q3AfterInitQualKehk": "43\nAnya's father, Aust, was our wisest \nElder. He was killed along with the \nother Elders who erected the ward that \nprotects this city. The ward has kept \nBaal's demons out of Harrogath, but at \na costly sacrifice. \n \nNihlathak, on the other hand, was the \nonly Elder to escape the demons. \nSomehow, he alone managed to find \nsanctuary, while the others died \naround him.\n \nEver since that day, Nihlathak and Anya \nhave been at odds.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnCain": "60\nNihlathak's story does sound \nreasonable, considering what I've \nheard about Anya. However, the best \nlies are often hidden within truth.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnLarzuk": "56\nAs the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is \nthe only person, besides Nihlathak, \nwho has any real knowledge of Mount \nArreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our \nfate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnMalah": "52\nIf it were anyone else, I would assume \nher dead. However, Anya is not so \neasily beaten. I know she must be alive.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnNihlathak": "46\nLook, I've told you! She's dead! If you \nknew what was good for you, you'd \nconcentrate your efforts on saving \nHarrogath -- not on lost causes like \nAnya.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnQualKehk": "81\nIt seems like everyone feels Nihlathak \nplayed a part in Anya's disappearance.\n \nWhy would he do such a thing?\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaAnya": "50\nHero. Nihlathak did this to me!\n \nIf you've come to help me, my only hope \nlies with Malah.\n \nPlease...Tell her you've found me...\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaCain": "54\nGoodness! Anya frozen by that fallen \nBarbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah \ncan help you where I cannot.\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaLarzuk": "80\nPoor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak \nwas a traitor...\n \nIf you find him alive, kill him for me!\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaMalah": "56\nSo! That snake Nihlathak was behind \nAnya's disappearance...and he trapped \nher with a freezing curse.\n \nHere. Take this potion to Anya and give \nit to her. That should release her.\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaQualKehk": "70\nThe snake has slipped our grasp! While \nyou were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.\n \nI'll bet Anya knows how to track him \ndown.\n",
 "A5Q3InitMalah": "43\nThere is a matter which I hesitate to \nshare, but I believe you are the only \none who can help me now.\n \nAnya, the young alchemist and \ndaughter to one of our slain Elders, \nhas been missing for some time. She is \na strong, crafty woman with a spirit \nlike no other.\n \nOne night, just before your arrival, I \noverheard her and Nihlathak arguing \nabout her father's death. The next \nmorning she was gone.\n \nNihlathak has his own tale as to where \nshe went and why. Don't believe him! I \nfear he is at the root of her \ndisappearance.\n \nPlease, if you can, search for Anya and \nbring her back to us. She'll know what \nto do about Nihlathak.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulAnya": "80\nThank you, hero, for rescuing me.\n \nTo show my personal gratitude, I give \nyou this. I had it custom-made for you \nby Larzuk.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulCain": "62\nFor one so young, Anya commands \ngreat respect. Now that she is here, I \nwill make it a point to talk to her about \nMount Arreat.\n \nYou should do the same.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulLarzuk": "67\nI never liked Nihlathak, but I never \nsuspected that he'd betray us! I just \ncan't understand how an Elder could do \nsuch a thing.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulMalah": "48\nThank you so much for bringing Anya \nback to us. I have devised this spell to \nincrease your resistances as a token of \nmy thanks. I know it isn't much, but I \nhope you find it helpful.\n \nPlease go talk to Anya. She has urgent \nnews concerning Nihlathak.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulQualKehk": "140\nYour rescue of Anya was quite an \naccomplishment.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitAnya": "90\nAs noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, \nnothing can excuse his actions.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitCain": "50\nRegretfully, I know very little about this \nRelic. However, if what the others say \nis true, then Baal must not gain \npossession of it.\n \nStop Nihlathak...before all is lost.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitLarzuk": "56\nNow, rescuing Anya -- that's good. \nTalking to me while Nihlathak hands \nover the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad!\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitMalah": "65\nMy worst fear has come true. Nihlathak \nhas gone mad.\n \nYou must stop him, before he gives the \nRelic to the Lord of Destruction!\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitQualKehk": "60\nI saw Nihlathak leave town just before \nyou found Anya. He must be held \naccountable for his criminal deeds.\n \nFind him and bring him back, if you can. \nLikely, he won't come willingly, and \nyou'll be forced to kill him.\n \nSo be it.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnAnya": "55\nNihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the \nRelic, he shall enter the mountain and \nwreak havoc there!\n \nI cannot believe that Nihlathak would \ngive the Relic to Baal in any kind of \ntrade. He's truly insane if he believes \nthat he can deal with the Lord of \nDestruction.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnCain": "58\nOhh...This is a truly horrible turn of \nevents.\n \nI know it seems you have always been \none step behind, my friend. But look at \nit this way...You have evil on the run.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnLarzuk": "160\n...What's there to talk about?\n \nKill Nihlathak!\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnMalah": "63\nNihlathak was never the kindest man. \nBut for him to betray the whole world...\n \nAhh...Where shall his soul finally rest?\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnQualKehk": "65\nMy advice is to go in quick and hit hard. \nNihlathak can't be half as tough as the \nbeasts you've faced out there.\n",
 "A5Q4InitAnya": "43\nNihlathak told me he struck a deal with \nBaal to protect Harrogath. In exchange \nfor the demon's mercy, the misguided \nfool plans to give Baal the Relic of the \nAncients, our most holy totem!\n \nDoing so will allow Baal to enter Mount \nArreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I \ntried to stop Nihlathak, but he \nimprisoned me in that icy tomb.\n \nNihlathak must be stopped before he \ndooms the whole world. As much as I \nwould love to strangle the life out of \nhim, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.\n \nYou must go to his lair through this \nportal I've opened, kill him, and then \nbring back the Relic of the Ancients.\n \nStop Nihlathak from destroying what we \nhave striven for eons to protect.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulAnya": "55\nYou have stopped Nihlathak, but he \ndidn't have the Relic! He must have \nalready given it to Baal. Now, Baal will \nnot be tested when he reaches Arreat's \nsummit.\n \n...Damn Nihlathak!\n \nI do thank you for trying, though. \nPlease, allow me to honor your courage \nby magically inscribing your name onto \nan item of your choosing. It's the least \nI can do.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulCain": "90\nBeware! Baal grows stronger with every \npassing moment.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulLarzuk": "93\nHmmm...What does Baal plan to do \ninside Mount Arreat?\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulMalah": "65\nSo, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on \nfailures past. It is your future that \nmatters more.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulQualKehk": "57\nNihlathak was a vile demon that shall \nfind his home among the tortured \nminions of Hell!\n \nYou battled the Darkness without fear. I \nlaud your skill and courage.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitAnya": "72\nYou wouldn't have to test yourself \nagainst the Ancients if it weren't for \nNihlathak's treachery. He was a fool \nand deserves to suffer for eternity.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitCain": "90\nA test of mettle is a fitting rite of \npassage for a Barbarian hero.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitLarzuk": "75\nEvery night, I've prayed to the Ancients \nto bring us peace...and now you must \nfight them.\n \nHuh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior?\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitMalah": "65\nBy reaching the summit, you cease \nbeing just a simple warrior. When you \ncome back, you will be far more.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitQualKehk": "63\nThe Ancients are not our enemies. \nRemember that! They are our \nancestors -- our gods.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnAnya": "71\nLook. I must apologize.\n \nI feel responsible for your current \nstruggle. If I had only stopped \nNihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, \nyou would not have to fight those \nghosts.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnCain": "52\nWe have come too far to be defeated \nnow, my friend. I have seen you \ncomplete many difficult quests. Though \nthis may be your greatest trial, it is not \nbeyond your reach.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnLarzuk": "70\nYou've walked on the burial grounds of \nour greatest ancestors. I'm not sure \nwhether I should bow before you or \nrevile you for committing sacrilege.\n \nTread lightly when you walk with gods.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnMalah": "68\nDo not doubt yourself. I believe you are \nworthy to pass through the Ancients' \ngates, but you must believe, as well.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnQualKehk": "114\nI warned you!\n \nThe Ancients are not like the demons \nyou're accustomed to fighting.\n",
 "A5Q5InitQualKehk": "37\nEvery time I hear of you, warrior, your \ndeeds become more legendary.\n \nBut take heed. You are approaching the \nvery summit of Mount Arreat. I have \nnever dared venture there. It is sacred \n-- our most holy place. The legends say \nit is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who \nblock the path of all who are unworthy.\n \nYour reputation here does not \nmatter...It will be the Ancients who \ndetermine your worthiness.\n \nGood luck.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulAnya": "82\nYou stand before me a worthy hero -- \nand on you rests the last hope of our \npeople.\n \nBear it well, warrior.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulCain": "67\nYou have proven yourself to these \npeople. They look to you as their \nwarrior, their champion.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulLarzuk": "82\nThe Ancients have honored you, and in \nturn, so do we. I have no remaining \ndoubts about you, now.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulMalah": "60\nI knew the Ancients would find you \nworthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, \nstop Baal before he destroys all that is \nsacred.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulQualKehk": "75\nBesting the Ancients in battle is a \nmighty feat indeed. I hope this means \nyou're ready to battle Baal.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnAnya": "60\nBaal has blocked Tyrael from entering \nthe Worldstone Chamber? This truly \nhas become a battle against Hell.\n \nWhether or not it was the Heavens' \ndecree, this is your fight now -- your \ndestiny.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnCain": "51\nRemember this. Baal once possessed Tal \nRasha, one of the most powerful of the \nancient Horadrim.\n \nYour battles with Mephisto and Diablo \nwill pale in comparison to your battle \nwith Baal.\n \nThe Lord of Destruction aided by Tal \nRasha's knowledge...The mountain \nitself will tremble when you clash.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnLarzuk": "59\nI may be just an armorer, but I know \nthis...Baal plans to destroy the world \nwith the secrets contained in that \nmountain. It doesn't take a genius to \nknow he has to be stopped.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnMalah": "70\nYou knew it would eventually come down \nto this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnQualKehk": "63\nYou have ventured to a place beyond \nlegend. You rush to face an evil few \ncan even imagine.\n \nBe careful, my friend, and may the Light \nwatch over you.\n",
 "A5Q6InitAncients": "31\nYou are a worthy hero! We augment \nyour skill and grant you entry to the \ninterior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies \nthe Worldstone.\n \nBeware. You will not be alone. Baal the \nLord of Destruction is already inside. \n \nThe Archangel Tyrael has always been \nour benefactor, but even he cannot \nhelp us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's \nspiritual presence from entering the \nchamber of the Worldstone. Only you, \nmortal, have the power to defeat Baal \nnow.\n \nBaal threatens the Worldstone -- and \nthrough it, the mortal realm, itself. You \nmust stop him before he gains full \ncontrol of the sacred stone. With it \nunder his control, Baal could shatter \nthe boundaries between this world and \nthe Burning Hells, thus allowing the \nhordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth \ninto the mortal realm like an \nunstoppable tide!\n \nIf you are weak, the world as you know \nit could be lost forever. You must NOT \nfail!\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulAnya": "53\nYou have done the impossible, hero. \nYour defeat of the last of the three \nPrime Evils is a great victory for the \nLight. \n \nStrange that you say that the \nWorldstone must be destroyed. The \nprophecies said nothing about that.\n \nPerhaps all we have fought for will be \nlost...or perhaps we'll never need fight \nagain!\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulCain": "40\nI knew in time you would defeat Baal. \nYou have done everything you set out \nto do, my friend.\n \nEver since you rescued me from \nTristram, I have believed in you. It has \nbeen a supreme honor to aid you along \nthe way. \n \nSo...The Worldstone was corrupted by \nBaal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. \nWorry not. Through whatever lies \nahead I have faith that the Light will \nguide us both.\n \nGo, now, back to the Worldstone \nchamber, and enter the portal Tyrael \nhas opened for you.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulLarzuk": "74\nThe Ancients themselves will envy our \nsongs about you.\n \nPlease, don't forget about us! Farewell, \nmy friend.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulMalah": "48\nIf Tyrael says the Worldstone must be \ndestroyed, then it must. We cannot let \nBaal's corruption prevail!\n \nThe world will change, true -- but who is \nto say it isn't for the better?\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulQualKehk": "60\nThe destruction of the Worldstone does \nnot bode well for our world. But I'll try \nnot to worry...\n \nAfter all, we have warriors like you \nfighting for us and for the Light.\n \nFarewell!\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulTyrael": "40\nI am impressed, mortal. You have \novercome the greatest challenge this \nworld has ever faced and defeated the \nlast of the Prime Evils. However, we are \ntoo late to save the Worldstone. Baal's \ndestructive touch has corrupted it \ncompletely.\n \nGiven enough time, the Worldstone's \nenergies will drain away and the \nbarriers between the worlds will \nshatter -- the powers of Hell will flood \ninto this...Sanctuary...and eradicate \nyour people and everything you've \nlabored to build.\n \nTherefore, I must destroy the corrupted \nWorldstone before the powers of Hell \ntake root. This act will change your \nworld forever -- with consequences \neven I cannot foresee. However, it is \nthe only way to ensure mankind's \nsurvival.\n \nGo now, mortal. I have opened a portal \nthat will lead you to safety.\n \nMay the Eternal Light shine upon you \nand your descendants for what you've \ndone this day. The continued survival \nof mankind is your legacy! Above all \nelse, you have earned a rest from this \nendless battle.\n",

 "CainAct3IntroGossip1": "45\nI've not set foot in glorious Kurast for \nmany years. But I never would have \nimagined it could be so corrupted.\n \nCertainly, this must be Mephisto's work! \nYou'd best get going, my friend. Diablo \nand Baal are still out there and you \nmust find them.\n",
 "CainAct4Gossip1": "48\nI have read much about the enigmatic \nArchangel Tyrael. He was revered in \nHoradrim lore both for his compassion \nfor mortals and his unquenchable \nspirit.\n \nIt was rumored that he went against the \nwishes of Heaven and gave the \nHoradrim the original Soulstones in \norder to trap Diablo and his Brothers.\n",
 "CainAct4IntroGossip1": "41\nCan you believe this place? Did you ever \ndare to dream that you'd one day \nstand upon the crossroads between \nHeaven and Hell? This Pandemonium \nFortress is truly miraculous.\n \nHowever, your journey is not yet over. \nDiablo still roams free in Hell, \nmarshalling his demonic forces. Only \nwhen he is beaten will our world finally \nhave peace.\n \nHurry now... the sands of time slow for \nno one! \n",
 "CainAct5Gossip1": "52\nWith hellspawn, size is no measure of \ntheir threat. Demons half the size of \nmen can kill with a gesture, while \nhellish pack animals trample any who \nstand in their way.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip10": "54\nIt is my belief that the Soulstones are at \nthe center of this conflict. If only that \nfool Marius had not intervened, Baal \nwould still be imprisoned within Tal \nRasha.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip2": "55\nThough these Barbarians are known \nthroughout the kingdoms as ferocious \nfighters, they are also capable of great \ncompassion.\n \nThey have trained throughout history \nfor a battle their legends foretell will \ndecide the fate of the world.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip3": "55\nThe angel Tyrael has watched over the \nguardians of Arreat throughout \nhistory. I do not believe that Baal and \nTyrael have come to fight over a paltry \nfew souls.\n \nThey are here to settle a conflict as old \nas time itself.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip4": "44\nDuring my time with the Horadrim, we \noften debated the nature of Mount \nArreat.\n \nWe knew that the Barbarian clans \nzealously guarded the mountain as \ntheir sacred duty. However, many \ndismissed their zeal as simple \nsuperstition...combined with an inborn \nhostility toward outsiders.\n \nThose Horadrim who trekked up Arreat \nwere never heard from again...Still, I \ndo not believe they died at the hands of \nBarbarians.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip5": "41\nAll users of the magical arts know of \nMount Arreat, but few understand its \ntrue nature. It is the nexus of an \nunfathomable magic.\n \nIt bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction \nraces to its summit with such purpose. \nI fear for the whole world should Baal \ngain what he seeks.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip6": "59\nI have spent decades trying to \nunderstand the forces at work in this \nworld. But in the face of all that is \ntranspiring, I realize how meager my \nknowledge is.\n \nI will be of assistance where I can, my \nfriend.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip7": "54\nThough the Elder Council of Harrogath \nis gone, there are many capable young \nleaders to take their place.\n \nAnya certainly has enough courage and \nintelligence to lead them all, if they can \nsurvive this catastrophe.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip8": "53\nAh, Anya. Such a fine example of \nfeminine strength...\n \nShe reminds me of the Zakarum \npriestesses I knew in my youth. They \ndon't take vows of chastity, you know.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip9": "65\nIt is fortunate that this town has such a \ntalented smith.\n \nThe quality of Larzuk's work surely \ncomplements your skills. In fact, he \nwould have been quite welcome \namongst the Horadrim.\n",
 "CainAct5IntroGossip1": "39\nI am amazed to find this place so \nuntouched. Everything else in the path \nof Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in \nruin. \n \nThese Barbarians must indeed be the \nlegendary guardians of Mount Arreat. \nThey are a proud, hardy people. Don't \nexpect to be greeted warmly -- \nstrangers here rarely are.\n \nPerhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend \nsome time with the townsfolk and try \nto understand them better. I'll let you \nknow what I discover.\n",
 "CainGossip1": "43\nLong ago, the Soulstones were given to \nthe Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. \nThey were used to bind the three Prime \nEvils. I now know that even these holy \nartifacts were no match for Diablo's \npower.\n \nI hope that his two brothers are more \nsecurely held... but I fear the worst.\n",
 "CainGossip2": "54\nIt takes time to master your skills... and \nuse will hone your technique. But take \ncare to choose your new skills wisely.\n",
 "CainGossip3": "52\nYou may recover some mysterious \nthings from the demons you kill. Some \nof great use to you... some of great \nperil! Bring them to me and I'll reveal \ntheir secrets.\n",
 "CainGossip4": "46\nHave I told you about the Horadrim? \nThey were an ancient confederation of \nmage-clans who sought to bind the \nthree Prime Evils for eternity. The \nHoradrim are now nearly forgotten... \nand it appears that the bonds they \nwove are unravelling!\n \nAs the last of the Horadrim, I pray that \nI can help you remedy their failure.\n",
 "CainGossip5": "43\nLong ago, Diablo and his brothers were \ncast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It \nseems that Hell's balance has shifted, \nas Andariel is now aligned with the \nLord of Terror. Her presence here in \nthe mortal realm does not bode well for \nus.\n",

I love being a blacksmith... \nbut sometimes I just want to get out \nand explore the world, you know?\n",
 "CharsiGossip2": "86\nI don't really know anything about Cain. \nHe seems to have a lot of secrets... \nThat makes me nervous.\n",
 "CharsiGossip3": "51\nOh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a \nlittle hard on outsiders, but who can \nblame her? All she wants is to protect \nour Order. But now that our Sisters \nhave turned against us... I think this \nwhole mess has hardened her heart.\n",

 "CharsiIntroGossip1": "47\nHi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here \nin camp. It's good to see some strong \nadventurers around here.\n \nMany of our Sisters fought bravely \nagainst Diablo when he first attacked \nthe town of Tristram. They came back \nto us true veterans, bearing some \nreally powerful items. Seems like their \nvictory was short-lived, though... Most \nof them are now corrupted by Andariel.\n",

I'm \nglad to know that once again caravans \nare free to travel through the Western \nPass.\n \nFor some time now, we have been under \nsiege by an evil power that I cannot \nidentify. Strange... It all began when a \nDark Wanderer came this way, looking \nfor the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one \nknows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper \nof Baal, is entombed, but it is certain \nto be far out in the desert.\n \nNow, my people whisper tales of the \ndead rising from their tombs and \nhorrible creatures lurking amongst the \nmoonlit dunes.

However, \neven though Bannuk could never admit \nit to me, as he grew older I could see \nthat same desire in his eyes.\n \nOh...It's a pity I didn't encourage him to \ngo with you. He might still be alive \ntoday.\n",

 "MalahGossip6": "53\nPerhaps you have heard the accounts \nof my son's horrible death at the hands \nof Baal's minions. He was my last living \nchild...\n \nThe oath of compassion I have taken as \na healer extends only to humankind.\n \nCut them down, warrior. All of them!\n",

 "MalahGossip8": "60\nQual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the \nlosses have borne heavily upon him. He \nis only impatient because he judges the \nworth of a warrior by action, not \nwords.\n \nYou must prove yourself worthy of his \ntrust.\n",
 "MalahGossip9": "52\nLarzuk possesses a good soul, but at \ntimes his mind seems quite unsound. \n \nHe once asked me for twenty of my \nfinest sheepskins. He said he would fill \nthem with hot air and float like a cloud \nabove the battlefield to spy on Baal's \nlegions! \n \nI worry the siege has driven him mad.\n",

I know now that I \nwas horribly mistaken.\n",

Some say that Diablo, the \nLord of Terror, walks the world again.\n \nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark \nWanderer did travel this route a few \nweeks ago. He was headed east to the \nmountain pass guarded by the Rogue \nMonastery.\n \nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to \nhave trailed in his wake. You see, \nshortly after the Wanderer went \nthrough, the Monastery's Gates to the \npass were closed and strange \ncreatures began ravaging the \ncountryside.\n \nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the \ngates are re-opened, I'll remain here \nwith my caravan. I hope to leave for \nLut Gholein before the shadow that fell \nover Tristram consumes us all.  If \nyou're still alive then, I'll take you \nalong.\n \nYou should talk to Akara, too. She \nseems to be the leader of this camp. \nMaybe she can tell you more.\n",

But never \nwhen a Paladin accompanied me. \n \nIndeed, your Order has saved me from \nlosing a small fortune over the years. I \njust hope you can discover what's \ngoing on around here and get the \nGates to the East opened up!\n",
